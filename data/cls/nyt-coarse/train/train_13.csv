sports,"madrid — spain coach vicente del bosque will be watching for carlo ancelotti's next real madrid starting xi with greater interest than usual after the italian opened the la liga campaign with iker casillas on the bench.the 32-year-old goalkeeper, long-standing captain for both club and country, saw diego lopez surprisingly chosen ahead of him at home to real betis on sunday, ancelotti's competitive debut at the helm.casillas was dropped and then suffered a bone fracture in his hand which kept him sidelined for a number of weeks under jose mourinho last season. when he returned from injury, january transfer window signing lopez remained first choice.the fragmentation of support for mourinho among the players, the fans and the media in his final months at the bernabeu were in a large part put down to the decision to keep casillas on the bench. some felt it was personal rather than professional.the arrival of the genial ancelotti has seen an easing of those tensions in and around the club, and many expected casillas to be restored to the number one jersey for the new campaign.""i took this decision for today,"" ancelotti said after real squeaked a 2-1 win over betis .""it's a decision taken on small details. i made it for this game. we'll see what happens in the next one.""i spoke to casillas, he is very professional and he is keen to play.""casillas has been undisputed first-choice keeper for club and country for more than a decade.he was won two european cups and five la liga titles with real, and captained the national team to their trio of consecutive titles at euro 2008 and, and at the world cup finals in. del bosque has always stood by him, and took him to the confederations cup and ecuador for last week's 2-0 friendly win, which may be one explanation for ancelotti's decision.casillas played the first half in guayaquil and barcelona's victor valdes, hardly a poor alternative, the second, but a tougher choice may need to be made for spain's upcoming world cup qualifiers if the madrid man is going to remain benched .spain top group i by a point from france with three games left to play, and they travel to play third-placed finland on september, their last away fixture. the finns held spain to a 1-1 draw back in march.valdes said he was surprised by ancelotti's decision at a news conference on monday.""i have seen iker make saves no one thought possible,"" he said. ""for me, he is the best but i shouldn't say any more because it isn't my team.""lopez has performed well when called upon at real, and is arguably better in the air and with his feet than casillas, but the man he is replacing is a national institution. online polls run by madrid-based sports dailies marca and as both showed a narrow majority of readers wanted to see casillas restored to the number one slot.real's starting xi for next monday's trip to play granada in la liga, a venue in which they suffered a 1-0 defeat last season, will be headline news in spain and could have del bosque rethinking his plans for next year's world cup finals in brazil .",1781
politics,"washington — john o. brennan's first difficult challenge at the c.i.a. may not be confronting the agency's future, but its past.mr. brennan, whose nomination is expected to be eventually approved by the senate, will take charge at the agency where he worked for 25 years just as it faces a sweeping indictment of its now-defunct interrogation program — a blistering, 6,000-page senate study that includes incendiary accusations that agency officials for years systematically misled the white house, the justice department and congress about the so-called enhanced interrogation techniques like waterboarding that were used on qaeda prisoners.by the account of people briefed on the report, it concludes that the program was ill-conceived, sloppily managed and far less useful in obtaining intelligence than its supporters have claimed.""it's a potential minefield for john brennan,"" said mark m. lowenthal, a former assistant c.i.a. director and former house intelligence committee staff director.the still-classified report by the senate intelligence committee will place mr. brennan squarely in the cross-fire between democratic critics of what they call a morally and practically disastrous experiment in torture, and some republican defenders who say the report is biased and fault president obama for banning coercive interrogations. and it could place mr. brennan in a difficult position inside the agency's headquarters in suburban virginia .if he endorses the senate report, he will be criticizing the many c.i.a. officers who worked on the program and challenging the stance of former directors, notably george j. tenet, who oversaw the brutal interrogations, and michael v. hayden, who has fervently defended them.""the career work force will be watching,"" said john a. rizzo, a top agency lawyer for 30 years before retiring in. ""hundreds who were part of the seven-year e.i.t. program — and who still believe it was the right and essential thing to do — are still there,"" he added, referring to enhanced interrogation techniques.the report, according to statements from some senators and descriptions from others who have reviewed it, documents in exhaustive detail how c.i.a. officials and consultants who ran the program gave top bush administration officials, members of congress, the american public and even their own colleagues — possibly including mr. brennan himself — a deeply distorted account of its nature and efficacy. after a bipartisan start in, republican staff members refused to participate in the writing of the report, making the four-year effort largely the work of democratic committee staff members .the agency missed a feb. 15 deadline to complete a review of the report, which has,000 footnotes referring to 6 million documents from c.i.a. files. it now appears likely that the response, offering the committee any factual corrections or broader judgments, will be delayed until mr. brennan's arrival.because mr. obama famously said he preferred to look forward, not back at his predecessor's counterterrorism programs, the senate report is by far the most thorough examination of how the united states came to use nudity, cold, sleep deprivation, stress positions, wall-slamming and waterboarding, methods it had long condemned as abuse or torture.mr. brennan will have to decide whether to support making a redacted version of the interrogation report public, as the committee is likely to support after the c.i.a. completes its review and as a united nations human rights adviser urged this week. several democratic senators and at least one republican, senator john mccain of arizona, who was tortured as a prisoner in north vietnam, have said that a declassified version must be released, and mr. brennan said he would give the request ""serious consideration.""he will have to decide whether to convene what the agency calls an accountability board to recommend punishment for current or former officials accused of mismanaging or misrepresenting the interrogation program . if he tries to keep the peace by dismissing the dispute as history and a distraction from the agency's current challenges, he will face strong resistance from the senate committee's democratic majority and mr. mccain.",1665
science,"for recovering alcoholics, memories associated with drinking — the smell of a bar, ice clinking in a glass — are among the greatest threats to sobriety.but what if retrieval of those memories could be blocked? using a drug typically given to organ-transplant patients, researchers at the university of california, san francisco, reduced the incidence of relapse in rats by disrupting memories linked to past drinking.for several weeks the researchers allowed rats to binge on alcohol. then, after 10 days of abstinence, the rats were exposed to just a drop of alcohol — enough to awaken their memories of drinking. the researchers then used brain scans to identify the neural mechanism responsible for triggering the reactivation of those memories, known as the mtorc1 signaling pathway.rapamycin, a drug known to disrupt the pathway, was then given to some of the rats. those that received it were significantly less likely to consume alcohol.""a single administration of this drug prevented relapse for a period of two weeks,"" said dorit ron, a neuroscientist at the university and an author of the study, which was published in the journal nature neuroscience. just how long the rats might have stayed dry is hard to say, she added, because ""two weeks is when we ended the study.""rapamycin, which is normally used to suppress transplant patients' immune systems, is already approved by the food and drug administration . but more study is required to determine whether it could help people abstain from alcohol, dr. ron said, adding that the drug also has significant side effects, including increased susceptibility to infection.",956

arts,"in music, creepiness is construct, almost totally in the ear of the listener. but a pair of shows on halloween night in brooklyn seemed, from a distance, as if they might be able to get beyond the usual camp-ghoul club nights — in which the audience turns up in costume and does most of the work — to achieve legitimate creepiness in and of themselves.both shows were slow, heavy and post-everything: evoking exhaustion and wonder, but also industrial decay, old factories by the river, rusted objects of great weight and unknown use. one group was the body, the metal-ish band from providence, r.i., at saint vitus, in greenpoint. the other was raime, the electronic music group from london, at the dance club output, in williamsburg.the body's recent records — especially the new ""christs, redeemers"" (thrill jockey ) — have gained gravity with the addition of a choir and strings; the band puts serene and spiritual voices and harmonies alongside its own rugged blasting from guitar, drums and voice. but the body's performances generally don't have the benefit of that contrast. at saint vitus on thursday, it was just the meaty, bearded band: chip king on guitar and vocals, and lee buford on drums, with the addition of a second drummer, seth manchester, and found-sound samples: speeches, rants, flotsam from an agitated culture.and something strange happened here. it's almost a natural law that two skilled drummers, playing strong in general tandem at medium tempos, sound good together — i mean good as in energizing, nourishing, sustaining. as go the allman brothers, so goes the body. all it took was mr. manchester following mr. buford's patterns, and suddenly the body was more than creepy: it was groovy, despite everything.what is everything? the music's obdurate vibe; the triple-layered distortion and bright slashes of feedback from the guitar, rendering harmony almost unintelligible; and mr. king's trademark vocal strategy. he is the rare singer who might request of the sound man, as he did on thursday, that his vocals be lower in the mix; then he positions the microphone at collarbone level and at least a foot away, and screams to be vaguely audible. it's different from the kind of singing that takes the audience into its confidence. it's singing that suggests that the singer has been abducted and held captive behind a wall.that's creepy, and their videos and press photos are creepier still, but the guys from the body are also kind of japing performance artists. at the end, after a headlining set that lasted maybe 40 minutes, the band members abruptly cued up a mellowly anodyne version of ""suicide is painless,"" from the film soundtrack to ""m.a.s.h.,"" over the p.a. system and, without skipping a beat, started packing up their gear.raime's music, as heard on its record from last year, ""quarter turns over a living line"" (blackest ever black, is echoey and resonant, extremely careful but strangely paced; it uses sounds suggesting cello and drums and guitar, as well as purely synthetic sources. there's a lot of waiting but also a lot of payoff; it's leaking drama all over the place, from beginning to end.unsurprisingly, the musicians behind it — tom halstead and joe andrews — care about visuals, too. thursday's set at output was raime's first performance in new york with a visual element: superslow-motion vignettes, apparently shot in a former portuguese ironworks, by the london-based dakus films .and this coherent, deeply centered set, dripped out in tempos and impact sometimes comparable to the body's, also yielded something beyond creepiness: beauty. the visuals accompanied the dread and almost symphonic gorgeousness in the music, some of it taken from ""quarter turns: you were never quite sure what you were seeing, but it involved blue-gray early-morning light by the water, blurry views of fire, a man covered in white dust.the enveloping sound system in the club allowed you to hear the music vividly, with focus and depth, as it moved along slowly and inexorably — every high-hat sound, menacing crackle and cloud of bass. and during a good stretch of it, many of the audience members — costumed and ready to dance — stood in place as the sound and film unfolded, as if they'd forgotten where they were and what day it was.",697
politics,"columbus, ohio — acknowledging that commencement addresses are no place for partisanship, president obama nonetheless skirted close to that political line on sunday, telling graduates at ohio state university to ignore antigovernment voices that ""gum up the works"" and instead aspire to be citizens who value both individual rights and community responsibilities.""unfortunately, you've grown up hearing voices that incessantly warn of government as nothing more than some separate, sinister entity that's at the root of all our problems,"" mr. obama told the crowd at the ohio state commencement ceremony. ""some of these same voices also do their best to gum up the works; they'll warn that tyranny is always lurking just around the corner. you should reject these voices."" ohio state graduates, their families and friends — almost,000 people in all — turned the university's huge football stadium into a sea of red and gray, the university's colors. mr. obama noted that it was his fifth visit to the campus in the past year, reflecting the importance of ohio and young voters to his re- election in november.but this was the president's first trip here in his young second term, which has already faced setbacks in congress over the budget and legislation to reduce gun violence and is now confronting the escalating violence in the middle east and a push to overcome republican opposition to an overhaul of immigration law that would provide a path to citizenship to about 11 million people who are in the country illegally .mr. obama will make another trip outside washington this week, this time to austin, tex., to press for long-blocked initiatives supporting infrastructure projects, education and a higher minimum wage . but in the commencement speech on sunday, the first of three that he plans to give during graduation season, mr. obama mostly steered clear of those subjects and others that he and republicans are fighting over. his address was both a pitch for good citizenship and an optimistic message as the economy recovers from the most serious recession since the great depression .""while things are still hard for a lot of people, you have every reason to believe that your future is bright,"" mr. obama said. ""you're graduating into an economy and a job market that is steadily healing.""the president described the graduates' generation as having a ""sense of service"" that ""makes me optimistic for our future."" ohio state's class of, he noted, included military veterans, volunteers for the peace corps and teach for america, and entrepreneurs who are already running start-up companies .their lives, he said, started as the cold war was ending and the internet age was beginning, and they came of age as the terrorist attacks of sept. 11, wars, recession and technological advances transformed america.""you've been tested and you've been tempered by events that your parents and i never imagined we'd see when we sat where you sit,"" he said. ""and yet despite all this, or perhaps because of it, yours has become a generation possessed with that most american of ideas — that people who love their country can change it for the better.""citizenship, he said, is sometimes seen ""as a virtue from another time, a distant past — one that's slipping from a society that celebrates individual ambition above all else, a society awash in instant technology that empowers us to leverage our skills and talents like never before, but just as easily allows us to retreat from the world. and the result is that we sometimes forget the larger bonds we share as one american family.""mr. obama urged the graduates to find not just a career but a cause for the greater good. perhaps, he said, they might even run for public office.""i promise you, it will give you a tough skin. i know a little bit about this,"" he said.

business,"washington — boeing acknowledged on tuesday that its original tests of the lithium-ion batteries on its 787 planes underestimated the risks of fire, though it defended its previous assessment that such a hazard was extremely unlikely.at the start of a two-day hearing held by the national transportation safety board, boeing's chief engineer on the, mike sinnett, said the calculation that a battery would fail only once every 10 million flight hours applied to the design of the battery and did not include possible manufacturing flaws. the testimony seemed to point to gs yuasa, the japanese manufacturer of the battery .the purpose of the safety board's hearing was to determine how boeing and the federal aviation administration — despite years of careful work — could have missed the potential for catastrophic failure when the battery was initially certified in. but the broader focus was how the plane's manufacturers and regulators can cope with rapid changes in technology that may outstrip their ability to predict problems. the 787 is the first major commercial airplane to make extensive use of lithium-ion batteries .the safety board is investigating the fire on jan. 7 in a japan airlines 787 parked at a gate at boston's logan airport. a second incident, involving a similar battery on an all nippon airways plane on a japanese domestic flight, led to the grounding of all 50 of the planes boeing has so far delivered.""we are here to understand why the 787 experienced unexpected battery failures following a design program led by one of the world's leading manufacturers and a certification process that is well-respected throughout the international aviation community,"" deborah a. p. hersman, the board's chairwoman, said.mr. sinnett said the failure calculation was based on data provided by gs yuasa . ""that value essentially is reached by experience with similar type cells,"" he said. "" gs yuasa had experience with over,000 cells of similar makeup. they had millions upon millions of those cells without any cell venting.""one of the tests consisted of driving a nail into a battery cell to provoke a short circuit . while the cell failed, the test did not result in a fire. but under repeated questioning, mr. sinnett acknowledged that the nail test had been inadequate and was not ""conservative enough."" boeing, he said, found that the batteries could catch fire only if they were overcharged.the boeing executive was pressed to say whether the company stood by its original risk estimate . he declined to do that until investigators could determine the cause of the two battery failures. ms. hersman did not seem satisfied with the answer. at one point she said, ""there is some obfuscation here.""during questioning, mr. sinnett gave a narrower definition of boeing's risk estimate than the company had in the past. ""that once in 10 million flight hours doesn't apply to things like abuse of the battery,"" he said. ""it doesn't necessarily apply to a nonconforming battery, meaning a battery that was not built for the type design. so there are other things that can cause the failure of a battery that don't contribute to that one in 10 million hours.""later in the day, representatives of gs yuasa responded by describing their intensive testing of the batteries and their long experience in making similar cells.boeing used a large number of subcontractors for the 787s. it picked a french company, thales, to provide the 787's power conversion system. thales, in turn, chose gs yuasa to build the lithium-ion batteries for the planes. but a gs yuasa executive made clear during the hearing that both boeing and thales were involved in all of its testing and design phases."" gs yuasa provided designs, and thales and boeing reviewed them and sometimes made suggestions and approved them,"" said takahiro shizuki, the manager of large-scale batteries at gs yuasa .the f.a.a. last week approved boeing's plans to fix the plane's lithium-ion batteries, an important step in lifting the grounding of the 787s in the united states . after the grounding of the fleet, boeing made several changes to its original battery design. these fixes include adding better insulation between the batteries' eight cells and building a stainless steel box that will encase the batteries and contain any fire and vent possible smoke or hazardous gases out of the planes.""there is still more work to be done in the investigation,"" ms. hersman said.boeing told the f.a.a. it planned to use lithium-ion batteries on its 787 in. because airplane regulations at the time did not cover such batteries, the f.a.a. in 2007 approved boeing's use under nine special conditions that covered the need to contain or vent any hazardous materials .mr. sinnett defended the plane maker's choice of lithium-ion batteries, saying at the hearing that the 787's certification by regulators took,000 hours and was the most ""extensive in our company's history."" he added that the battery's certification was ""very rigorous and subject to close scrutiny by the f.a.a.""yet the fire in boston also showed something that the regulators and the company did not expect: that a flaw, possibly no larger than a grain of sand, in a single cell could set off a chain reaction that would cause smoke or fire in adjacent cells.""we were focused on the hazards of the battery,"" said ali bahrami, a senior f.a.a. official in charge of the 787 certification. ""we knew the hazards were always there. the awareness was always there. we did the best we could under the circumstances, and the knowledge that existed then, to come up with standards that address the requirements for this particular battery .""steve boyd, another f.a.a. senior official, said: ""you have to look at the special conditions as a comprehensive and mutually supportive requirement intended not only to reduce the probability of a thermal event but to mitigate the effects of any of those failures if they occur.""it is the second public hearing by the safety board on lithium batteries . on april 11 and, the board held a two-day forum focused mostly on the batteries as cargo and components in devices carried by passengers.",1919
sports,"indian trail, n.c. — the long island mansion that rick dipietro bought in the heyday of his career with the islanders is on the market . these days, he is downsizing. home, for now, is a room at a residence inn in suburban charlotte, n.c., a place where hockey is about as popular as surfing in winnipeg .dipietro, the former franchise goalie for the islanders, signed a 25-game contract with the charlotte checkers of the american hockey league in late october. far from the focus of the news media and the intense criticism from fans, dipietro hopes to begin resurrecting a career that once made him an n.h.l. all-star and an olympian.""out of sight, out of mind sometimes isn't a bad thing,"" dipietro, 32, said after a recent practice. ""i definitely appreciate the fact that i'm kind of under the radar here.""with the islanders, dipietro never matched the expectations that came with a 15-year, $67.5 million contract he signed in. a series of hip, knee and head injuries limited dipietro to 50 games in his final five seasons before the islanders sent him to bridgeport of the a.h.l. in february. they bought out his contract in july at.5 million a year through.dipietro, the no. 1 overall pick in 2000 out of boston university, could have walked away from hockey a rich man. instead, he spent the summer and fall working out with a goalie coach in connecticut and a trainer in toronto, driving back and forth while waiting for the phone to ring.""i don't think i could go to sleep at night not knowing that i gave it one last try to see what i could do,"" he said.dipietro finally got his shot when injuries last month left the carolina hurricanes short-handed in goal. carolina general manager jim rutherford signed dipietro for the checkers, his team's a.h.l. affiliate.""there's been some really dark, tough, trying times,"" said dipietro, who credits his wife, cassandra, and renewed faith for helping him through the lows. although he said jokingly last season that he had thought about driving off the throgs neck bridge, dipietro dismisses reports that he seriously considered suicide.a humble dipietro has worked to fit in with his charlotte teammates, earning praise from checkers coach jeff daniels for his attitude and approach. dipietro is trying not to look too far ahead. or back.the checkers were recently in toronto to play the marlies at the same time the islanders were there to play the maple leafs . the teams stayed at the same hotel . dipietro kept his distance.""i've talked to a bunch of them on the phone and text messages,"" he said of his former teammates, ""but it might have been a little bit hard for me maybe, at this point. i don't know if it's all actually sunk in yet. i always thought i'd end up with one team the rest of my career, retired, be a part of the organization, all that kind of stuff you dream about when you sign a deal like that. but it didn't work out. kind of move on.""still, dipietro has had a difficult start with charlotte . he is 0-4 with a.18 goals-against average and an.846 save percentage in his first five games, including a 4-3 loss to the rockford icehogs on sunday in which he made 26 saves. on a recent night, when rutherford went to a mostly empty time warner cable arena to watch him play, dipietro allowed five goals on 15 shots against the hershey bears and was pulled midway through the second period of a 5-3 loss.""he doesn't have his confidence now,"" said rutherford, a former n.h.l. goalie. ""that position, more than any other position in hockey, it's important to have your confidence, and so he's probably thinking too much while the game's on, which isn't a good thing.""dipietro conceded that it had been tough.""i came here having not practiced with a professional team or really organized practices at all, and having new equipment and new skates and everything else and then just jumping into a game probably wasn't the best thing to do,"" he said. ""but at the end of the day, games are the only way you can really get that exposure to what you need to try to get sharp.""but dipietro may be running out of time. the hurricanes' starting goalie, cam ward, is back from a groin injury . although ward's backup, anton khudobin, remains out, the third-string goalie, justin peters, has played well. the hurricanes and the checkers have six goalies between them. rutherford said a move would most likely be made this week.""best- case scenario for him was he came in immediately and played well and justin peters didn't play well,"" rutherford said of dipietro. ""but it didn't work that way. justin peters played extremely well, and rick didn't get back to the level that we would have expected him to in a short period of time.""will charlotte be dipietro's last stop? he does not know and is not looking that far ahead. but in the end, he may not be the one who makes that call.""it's something every athlete struggles with — when's the right time,"" he said. ""i don't know if i'll ever know when the right time is. i said it to my wife the other day: i'd rather someone just tell me when the time is. i know it's tough to make that decision on your own.""",1021
arts,"in search of some live brazilian music a few months ago, i found my way to dizzy's club coca-cola, in the time warner center, where the brazilian percussionist duduka da fonseca was leading a quintet. i can't say i knew much about mr. da fonseca before i heard his band that night, and among the things i didn't know was that his quintet's regular reed player was a 38-year-old israeli woman named anat cohen, who has lived in new york since.on the first few tunes of the set — mostly the kind of fast-paced, brazilian-tinged jazz i've always loved — ms. cohen played the reed instrument most closely associated with postwar jazz: the tenor saxophone. it was immediately apparent that she was a terrific musician, fluid, full-throated, with a knack for creating beautifully crafted, even eloquent solos. around the fifth song, however, the quintet began playing ""chorinho pra ele,"" a simple, infectious samba by hermeto pascoal, the great brazilian multi-instrumentalist. and that's when ms. cohen did something you rarely see a jazz reed player do these days. she took out her clarinet.as good as her saxophone playing was, ms. cohen on the clarinet was a revelation. using the clarinet's upper register, she could evoke infectious joy. in the lower register, her playing could conjure a deep, soulful melancholy. on up-tempo numbers, her improvisations weren't just bebop fast; they had a clarity and deep intelligence that is really quite rare. she made it look effortless, even as she was playing the most technically difficult of all the reed instruments. she only played a handful of songs on the clarinet that night, but every time she did, she took my breath away.i suppose i could say that i'd never heard anyone play the clarinet quite like that, which would be true enough. (as i later learned, she's been the jazz journalists association's clarinetist of the year for the last six years.) but let's be honest here: like many jazz fans, i have rarely heard anyone play live jazz clarinet.a dominant instrument in jazz's early years, the clarinet faded into obscurity as the saxophone became the reed instrument of choice once charlie parker and his alto sax helped birth the bebop movement. when you think of jazz clarinetists, only a handful of names spring to mind, including benny goodman and artie shaw, whose heyday was the 1930s, and woody allen, whose playing will never cause anyone to forget that he makes his living as a filmmaker.watching ms. cohen that night, i thought of another clarinet player: myself. all through grade school, i took lessons, but in high school, as i became captivated by jazz, i tossed the clarinet aside and took up the saxophone and flute. in the little high school group i played in, i don't think i ever once trotted out my clarinet. in high school jam sessions, every reed player was a saxophonist. the clarinet was just, well, uncool. (""highly mediocre"" would be a generous way to describe my playing.)i could imagine ms. cohen having those same feelings as a teenager. i could picture her abandoning her clarinet in favor of the hipper, harder-edge tenor sax. what i wound up wondering was what led ms. cohen back to the clarinet? and what did her re-embrace of it say not only about her, but about the clarinet's potential to become a mainstream jazz instrument again?""i wanted to be john coltrane,"" ms. cohen said with a laugh a few days later, when we met in her small east village office. the second of three children, ms. cohen grew up surrounded by music; her brothers were also aspiring jazz musicians . (indeed, all three cohens are musicians today: older brother, yuval, plays the soprano saxophone, while younger brother, avishai, is a trumpeter. they often play together as the 3 cohens.) by the time they were in their early teens, the cohens were all enrolled in a music conservatory in tel aviv .ms. cohen took up the clarinet because the conservatory needed clarinet players, and she was amenable. the instrument fit well with her first introduction to jazz: the conservatory's dixieland band, which she joined. ""i discovered that i loved the music of new orleans,"" she said. the clarinet, of course, was an important instrument in early new orleans jazz.but as her tastes broadened, ms. cohen fell under the sway of coltrane, the great 1960s tenor saxophonist. in high school, a teacher told her that her clarinet really didn't fit with the modern jazz she liked. ""i kind of put a cap on my clarinet without really thinking about it,"" she recalled.by the time she enrolled in berklee college of music in boston in, she was a committed tenor saxophonist, wanting nothing so much as to emulate the ""sheets of sound"" that coltrane made so famous.at berklee, she occasionally picked up the clarinet — ""whenever they needed a clarinet player, they called me"" — and remembers one of her professors telling her that she ""really had a sound on the clarinet."" but she let the remark pass. by, she had moved to new york, and was making her way as a professional musician. she was the tenor saxophonist in an all-female jazz ensemble called the diva jazz orchestra. her friend, the brazilian saxophonist daniela spielmann, recalled that when she first met ms. cohen, ""all she ever played was the saxophone.""",1716

""so when thanksgiving comes, and you are not calling everyone to tell them that you are going, it is an unambiguous blow to your film .""every year many independent films that don't get to go to sundance usually pop up later as big fish in smaller festival ponds, like south by southwest in march or tribeca in april. last year the documentary "" undefeated "" was passed over by sundance, so its directors, t. j. martin and dan lindsay, took their uplifting story of a tennessee high school football team to south by southwest, in austin, tex. the film was acquired there for distribution and went on to win the oscar for best documentary .not getting into sundance can mean not getting lost at sundance, where some films end up with undesirable early-morning screening times. ms. sherman, who first worked on her semiautobiographical script 20 years ago, is feeling a lot more positive after searching online for ways to cope and finding other filmmakers denied by sundance, artists she can identify with and learn from. the rejection ""doesn't mean your movie is not good,"" said ms. sherman, who, after focusing on raising two children, shot ""claire's cambodia"" with the help of her writer-director husband, billy ray (""shattered glass, in their home in los angeles . ""it could just be the odds.""she rushed her edit to make the submission deadline, she said, adding that having more time to tweak it has made it a better film . now she hopes to embrace her underdog status at another festival and ""tell everyone at the q. and a. how my film was turned down by sundance,"" she said, ""after everyone has been cheering my film .""the director david lowery argued that being denied by sundance is the mark of a true independent filmmaker. ""the sense of struggle really bonds people,"" he said.mr. lowery, who can remember wallowing in a ""very clich, melancholy"" walk in a cold november rain after an early rejection from sundance, endured many more over 10 years as he learned to ""bite the bullet,"" he said. ""and then you move on to plan b.""finally, in, he had a short accepted there. this year his feature ""ain't them bodies saints "" made it in and is the subject of early positive buzz. mr. lowery, a texas native, can credit slamdance, the upstart festival that takes place in park city at the same time as sundance, and south by southwest with giving him his first big break. both showed his 2008 sundance-rejected short, ""a catalog of anticipations.""janet pierson, who leads the film program at south by southwest, known as sxsw, said that her festival, which received more than,000 submissions this year, is more of an alternative than a steppingstone, as it is aimed less toward industry professionals than it is toward do-it-yourself filmmakers in a more relaxed atmosphere. lena dunham, who created hbo's ""girls,"" said, ""i never tried to premiere anything anywhere but sxsw."" her first film, ""creative nonfiction,"" made its debut in austin in, laying the path for ""tiny furniture"" the next year there and eventually ""girls.""still, ms. dunham's lack of interest in sundance is rare. the festival's early spot on the calendar and its enduring reputation as the best place to attract distributors mean all other festivals follow it, just as they do in a scrawled list on a wall in derek watson's office in oklahoma city . mr. watson, who directed the documentary short ""this is normal,"" about developing access to water in africa, was rejected by sundance. his first response was to cross that name off his list and to look at the festivals written below it, including south by southwest and the true/false documentary festival in missouri .""the finality of it hits you hard,"" said mr. watson, who recalled sitting in a dusty, deprived village in africa, fantasizing about projecting images of its plight in utah .frustrated filmmakers might find solace in knowing that sundance programmers also suffer under the weight of the numbers. ""there's as much pressure, if not more,"" said the sundance director, john cooper, who has worked as a programmer there for 23 years. ""we reject films that would have been shown 20 years ago ."" (consider that even a decade ago, the number of films submitted, 5,000 for 219 slots, was many thousands fewer than the number today.)still, the digital age that provides cheaper tools for filmmakers has also led to more outlets for distribution . robyn miller, who with his brother created the popular '90s video game myst, is hoping to start a second career as a filmmaker. his pseudo- documentary, ""the immortal augustus gladstone,"" was rejected by sundance, but he said he was only momentarily disappointed.""the festival model is old,"" mr. miller said. being from the computer world, he said, he'll distribute his film ""directly to people,"" on the internet through a site like itunes or netflix .that's a resourcefulness that mr. cooper would encourage. ""filmmakers need to be creative,"" he said. ""they should use the cleverness it takes to make a movie to also find an audience.""for one first-time feature director, jono oliver, the most creative way is still through sundance, even though his film wasn't accepted there. mr. oliver, a longtime assistant director from brooklyn whose film, ""home,"" is about a man with mental illness, has turned his rejection into a ticket to crash the party . he's planning to blanket the town with 250 posters and hold press and industry screenings at a rented condo, accompanied by cocktail parties and a popcorn machine, in hopes of catching sundance runoff .""the endgame was not to get into sundance,"" mr. oliver said. ""that was a step to getting distribution . i am not going to take no for an answer.""",1392
business,"frankfurt — germany, which has often scolded other countries for accumulating too much debt and not being competitive enough in the global economy, now finds its own economic policy under heavy attack .the european commission on wednesday began an extensive review into whether germany's huge trade surplus, which stood at.9 billion euros, or.7 billion, in the second quarter of this year, is threatening the rest of the bloc, a question with fundamental implications for world growth .though couched in diplomatic language, the critique on wednesday from the european commission's president made clear that resentment toward germany in the euro zone had boiled up from the fringes of the region's heavily indebted countries to become part of the official conversation in brussels .there was also criticism wednesday from within germany itself. the government's own council of economic experts accused political leaders of undercutting future growth by failing to invest enough in education and by undoing changes to the labor market that had helped cut unemployment in half. the united states drew attention to the issue last month when it called on germany to do more to stimulate domestic demand, to become a better customer for the rest of europe's goods and services rather than just a consummate seller of german products.the broadsides came at a sensitive time for chancellor angela merkel, who has been in negotiations to form a new government after the german elections almost two months ago .germany stands accused of not doing enough to encourage spending at home as a way to redress the imbalance between its enormous exports of goods like cars and machinery and its more meager imports. many economists and policy makers argue that germany would help itself as well as its neighbors by cutting taxes, investing more in aging infrastructure like roads and water treatment plants and increasing spending on education .such projects would create jobs and increase incomes in germany, the argument goes, and the money would spread to the rest of the euro zone when germans bought products like alfa-romeo cars from italy or took vacations in greece or spain.the council of economic experts warned that in the eight years that ms. merkel had been chancellor, the german government had not built on the deregulation of the labor market that was begun by her predecessor, gerhard schröder. the changes helped cut german unemployment in half, but the council warned that the government seemed to be backtracking on some of the changes.essentially, the council was stating what many people in other euro zone countries have grumbled about for years: that german leaders do not follow their own economic advice."" the german government,"" the council wrote, ""should not give the impression that it expects — or even demands — painful adjustment processes from other countries, but shies away from unpopular measures for germany.""olli rehn, the europe's commissioner for economic and monetary affairs, said on wednesday that ""we are not criticizing germany's external economic competitiveness or its success in global markets . in fact, that is what we want from all e.u. member states .""germans themselves debate whether they invest enough in their own country,"" mr. rehn said. ""more demand in germany can also spill over to the vulnerable countries in varying degrees .""the debate in brussels is analogous to the argument that has taken place for years about the united states' trade deficit with china, said mujtaba rahman, director for europe at eurasia group, a political consulting firm .""these large imbalances aren't good for global growth,"" mr. rahman said. ""what's happening in europe is a microcosm of that conversation.""in berlin, officials of the finance and economic ministries reacted more calmly to the criticism from europe than they did two weeks ago, when the united states treasury department suggested that germany's trade surplus was a threat to the world economy .",954
science,"los angeles (ap) — the face of mars is dotted with a maze of channels, pointing to possible ancient megaflood episodes.now scientists peering below the surface have uncovered the first evidence of underground channels apparently created by flooding — a finding that's expected to further illuminate the role of water in mars' history.using a ground-piercing radar sensor aboard the mars reconnaissance orbiter, a team of scientists created 3-d maps of an equatorial region known as elysium planitia and the channels that run underneath the plains.besides the contributions from rovers and landers, ""our view of the red planet has largely been restricted to looking at the surface"" from orbiting spacecraft, said lead researcher gareth morgan, a planetary scientist at the smithsonian institution .the research, published online thursday in the journal science, offers a new perspective below the martian surface and hints of past flooding at a time when the planet was mostly thought to be cold and desert-like. the channels remained hidden because the once volcanically active region had been filled in by lava flows hundreds of millions years ago .dry channels on the martian surface were first spied by mariner 9 in. later observations by the viking spacecraft suggested the geologic features were likely carved by water. mars missions since then have used sophisticated instruments to image these winding channels .the latest 3-d maps, painstakingly pieced together from radar data collected by numerous spacecraft passes, have already changed scientists' notions: the channels are deeper than expected, a sign that flooding was more extensive than generally believed.morgan said the origin of the ancient floodwaters likely came from a deep reservoir and were possibly unleashed by a volcanic eruption.brown university mars expert john mustard called the new work ""totally cool and significant.""""it shows a completely new dimension for considering the evolution of mars,"" mustard, who was not part of the study, said in an email.",537
arts,"donating her file cabinet, full of old journals, letters and zines to new york university's fales library archive was a bittersweet move for kathleen hanna. a singer and founder of the riot grrrl band bikini kill and the feminist electro-pop act le tigre, ms. hanna had been a den mother to contemporary-girl culture for a generation, but she was still only a midcareer artist, too young to grapple with archiving her work. the donation helped legitimize the riot grrrl movement.but ms. hanna, 44, had more personal reasons for securing her legacy: she wasn't sure how much longer she'd be around.timing has played a big part in ms. hanna's creative life since she emerged from the diy scene in olympia, wash., in the early 1990s. the brief but influential riot grrrl movement seemed to arrive at just the right moment, during debates about workplace harassment and young women's sexuality, fresh issues that still resonate today. but over the last few years, even with a '90s revival in full swing and her view in high demand, ms. hanna had all but disappeared from public life.the reason for her absence, as she is just beginning to reveal, was illness, depression and artistic flux. ""i'm still not sure, day to day, if i'm going to wake up and be really sick,"" she said.late in, after six years of a mysterious and debilitating illness that often left her too weak to move or speak, she was finally diagnosed with late-stage lyme disease. she underwent two years of intensive therapy. now on the mend, ms. hanna is returning in a big way.she resurrected a 1997 solo project, julie ruin, as a band, the julie ruin; its debut album, ""run fast,"" is to be released tuesday on tjr records, a label formed by ms. hanna and her band mates . for the first time, the group is touring nationally, beginning with a sold-out show at the bowery ballroom on tuesday. and a documentary about her, ""the punk singer,"" which has been making the festival rounds since it had its premiere to warm reviews at south by southwest this spring, is due to be in theaters in november.seeing these projects come to fruition at once is stressful but empowering, ms. hanna said. ""i am like somebody who maxed out their credit cards because they thought they were going to die,"" she said, ""and i lived.""walking through chelsea recently, she fretted about a girly bit of overshare. whether some overwrought teenage poetry was on view, in her bubble -letter handwriting, at the fales's riot girl collection, where ms. hanna donated her work in. that material and others were anthologized in ""the riot grrrl collection,"" an anthology published this summer. ms. hanna further tells her story — including sexual abuse and naming nirvana's hit ""smells like teen spirit"" — in the documentary, directed by sini anderson. footage of her bopping onstage in her trademark high ponytail masked her illness; she announced a retirement of sorts from le tigre in.the julie ruin was reborn during her illness, as a way for ms. hanna to connect to her artistic identity. ""i was like: 'is this who i am now, this sick person? this isn't me,' "" she said in an interview in a cafe not far from her flatiron apartment, one of two homes she shares with her husband adam horovitz, a k a ad-rock of the beastie boys. he encouraged her to sing as much as she could. ""when i would practice and i would feel o.k., i saw me again,"" she said.she conceived the group as what she called her ""dream band,"" with players from different walks of her life: on bass, her bikini kill band mate kathi wilcox; on guitar, sara landeau, an instructor at the willie mae rock camp for girls, where ms. hanna occasionally teaches; on drums, her friend carmine covelli; and kenny mellman, herb of the cabaret act kiki & herb, as a keyboardist and songwriter. they rehearsed casually around town and at ms. hanna's new jersey home — ""i can't call it jamming, because i hate that; i don't jam,"" she said — without considering where it would lead.according to ms. wilcox, ""when she approached me to join the band, she was sort of like, 'we may never tour, we may never make a record, but we're just doing this now for fun, because i need to.' ""but ms. hanna arrived with some songs intact — including one, ""just my kind,"" written for christina aguilera — and though she didn't have an overarching sound in mind, she knew what she liked. ""i know i love sexy surf guitars, i know i love loud snare,"" she said. ""i love really simple repeating bass lines, and i love weird mad scientist keyboard sounds.""mr. mellman, a musical savant and a voracious consumer of new bands, gave himself the task of keeping the julie ruin up-to-date. ""the last thing i wanted was for it to start sounding like a '90s revival,"" he said.the album, which the group created for about,000, is energetically punky, with new-wave synths and beats. (james murphy of lcd soundsystem mixed ""just my kind; ms. hanna did the same for the single, ""oh come on."") lyrically, the songs take a dark turn. the title track is about tumultuous girlhood. "" party city"" is defiant about death. there are several peppy numbers about euthanasia.""it sounds really cute,"" mr. mellman said. ""then it's like the kitten with the claws.""ms. hanna said she has always loved juxtaposing the sweet and sad with silly. and writing without a specific political agenda was a release: bikini kill and le tigre covered that ground, she said, and a new generation of artists and writers, including pussy riot, are taking up the cause. ms. hanna has found acolytes in the likes of tavi gevinson, publisher of the youth magazine rookie .more leaps may be in her future. she is designing for an as-yet-unnamed fashion label with ms. wilcox. with her husband, she has created a tv comedy starring the downtown performers bridget everett, neal medlyn and murray hill; they are shopping the script. she thinks about writing country songs and doing a one-woman show at.being forced to take artistic stock because of her illness wasn't easy. ""i have to live with historicizing myself maybe a little bit too soon,"" she said. ""i mean, i'm, i'm not.""then again, she said, ""it's really freeing. i'm not some young 20-year-old ing énue who's reinventing the wheel. in a way, the pressure is off. i'm just happy to be here."" her contribution has been documented. ""so now i can do whatever i want, and trust that i'm a good artist.""",1922
politics,"jefferson city, mo. — looking for the new health insurance marketplace, set to open in this state in two months, is like searching for a unicorn.the marketplace, or exchange, being established by the federal government under president obama's health care law has no visible presence here, no local office, no official voice in the state and no board of local advisers. it is being run like a covert operation, with no marketing or detailed information about its products or their prices.while states like colorado, connecticut and california race to offer subsidized insurance to their citizens, missouri stands out among the states that have put up significant obstacles. it has refused to create an insurance exchange, leaving the job to the federal government . it has forbidden state and local government officials to cooperate with the federal exchange .it has required insurance counselors to get state licenses before they can help consumers navigate the new insurance market . and, like many states, it has refused to expand medicaid .""it's like running an obstacle course every day of the week, but the course changes from day to day,"" said herb b. kuhn, president of the missouri hospital association, a strong advocate of expanded coverage . state senator rob schaaf, the republican author of a 2012 ballot measure that prevented the state from setting up its own insurance exchange, said: ""we can't afford everything we do now, let alone provide free medical care to able-bodied adults. i have a philosophical problem with doing that, and i'm also worried about our country's financial situation .""over,000 missouri residents, including low-income people in st . louis and kansas city, family farmers and small-business employees, are uninsured. many could qualify for coverage through the exchange, which encourages competition and offers subsidies to reduce costs .kenneth l. schmidt, an insurance broker in st . louis who intends to sell insurance products offered on the exchange, said: ""we have not seen any evidence of the federal exchange — how it will be run, how it will be structured in missouri . will it be run from jefferson city ? will it be run from washington ? who will watch over it? no clue.""david r. griggs, who owns a carpet store with 15 employees in columbia, mo., said he was hungry for information about the exchange . but, he said, ""i have not seen or heard a word about it.""kat cunningham of columbia, the president of moresource, a firm that handles payroll and benefits for more than 600 employers, said she had been deluged with questions from clients and was struggling to provide guidance.she said her clients wanted to know: ""where do we go to purchase health care coverage ? how much will it cost us? if we can't afford it, what then?""private foundations and community groups have stepped into the vacuum. m. ryan barker, vice president of the missouri foundation for health, said his organization planned to spend $8 million this year on a campaign to secure coverage for,000 of the uninsured. ""the state government is not doing a whole lot, its hands are tied, so we are taking on a bigger role,"" he said.jennifer g. bersdale, executive director of missouri health care for all, a grass-roots organization, has been educating thousands of people about what she sees as an exhilarating prospect. ""people who have been shut out of the market for years will soon be able to get good insurance, cannot be denied because of pre-existing conditions and can get financial assistance to afford it,"" she said. missouri is one of a handful of states where the federal government directly enforces the consumer protections of the affordable care act because the state lacks the authority to do so. in, missouri voters overwhelmingly approved a ballot measure expressing opposition to the federal requirement for most americans to have health insurance .in november, voters approved a ballot measure that prohibits the governor and other state officials from establishing or operating a state -based insurance exchange unless authorized by a vote of the people or by the state legislature . the measure says state and local officials cannot provide ""assistance or resources of any kind"" to a federal exchange unless such assistance is specifically required by federal law . it authorizes taxpayers and state legislators to sue state and local officials who flout its restrictions. the threat of lawsuits has made local officials cautious. gov . jay nixon, a democrat, said debate on the ballot measures had been highly political. he has held dozens of events to promote the expansion of medicaid, stressing its economic benefits for the state . but republicans hold two-thirds of the seats in each house of the legislature .""a core principle of public health is to increase access to health care,"" said josephine p. waltman, the health officer for phelps county. but, she said, the ballot measure limits what local officials can do and is forcing them to consult lawyers .as a result, ms. waltman said she and her staff would distribute general information about the insurance exchange, but would not sit down with people at computers to help them choose health plans and see if they qualify for subsidies . ""i would love to do that,"" she said.",1124
politics,"chicago — seeking to repair one of the nation's worst -financed public pension systems, legislative leaders in illinois on friday began urgently trying to sell a rescue plan that cuts cost-of-living increases for retirees, raises the age of retirement for some employees, and sets a cap on pensions for those with the highest salaries .the details of the proposed deal to save $160 billion over 30 years were handed out to rank-and-file lawmakers as the state's leaders sought to solve the state's pension crisis and move beyond many months of contentious debate. but the deal, announced without any detail on wednesday, seemed certain to create a showdown in the capital, springfield, next week.around the nation, officials wrestling with rising pension costs and underfinanced systems will be watching closely to see if illinois, a populous state under the control of democrats and the home of president obama, is willing to challenge labor. for democrats especially, given a long alliance with unions, the notion of slashing retirement benefits to bolster pension systems is politically difficult.for many state and local governments, pension costs have become a central challenge with no easy political or legal answers. detroit officials have cited.5 billion in unfunded pension costs among a list of debts that has left that city seeking federal bankruptcy protection . in san jose, calif., chuck reed, the democratic mayor, championed efforts to pass a referendum to reduce pension benefits, though city workers say the move is illegal. the mayor now says he hopes to mount a statewide ballot initiative next year that would change the state constitution to allow cities to cut pension benefits .under the plan being debated in illinois, the state would be required to make additional payments into the pension system until it is fully funded, no later than the end of. workers who are 45 or younger would need to retire later — working as much as five years longer, depending on their age. and cost-of-living increases would apply only toward a portion of a person's pension in many cases, under a formula based on how long they held their job.while top legislative leaders of both parties here say they are working to win enough votes to pass an overhaul many fiscal experts call necessary, if painful, labor leaders denounced the plan as ""catastrophic,"" and written behind closed doors without public comment . they said they intended to lobby lawmakers against it at every opportunity before a vote during a special session scheduled for tuesday.""this is a grotesque taking of employees' retirement security that seems both patently illegal and unfair,"" said daniel j. montgomery, the president of the illinois federation of teachers. ""it's a sharp jab in the eye — and the heart — of public employees. there's a lot of anger out there.""for years, the state has wrestled with an overwhelming pension problem. the system is underfunded by $100 billion, helping to make illinois the state with the worst credit rating in the nation. that has meant, according to a recent report, that about 20 cents of every taxpayer dollar must be dedicated to pensions, money that could go to other state needs.still, answers have been hard to come by. democratic leaders in the legislature have long disagreed about how to solve the problem without infuriating labor unions and how to navigate the illinois constitution, which prohibits pension benefits from being ""diminished or impaired."" gov . pat quinn, a democrat who is expected to have a difficult re- election challenge in, has repeatedly put solving the pension crisis at the center of his agenda, and leaving the issue unaddressed would offer endless fodder for a strong cast of republican candidates who want his job. rahm emanuel, the mayor of chicago and a democrat, has also vehemently urged lawmakers to change the state system, and, in so doing, to create a model for changes to the deeply underfinanced pension system in his own city, the state's largest .still, in what was perhaps a sign of how politically delicate the issue is, the special session was called for tuesday, a day after the filing deadline for any primary challenges. that means lawmakers will know which of them might be most vulnerable to an election fight if they approve the measure.if some democrats were worried that the proposed changes go too far in cutting benefits for unions, some republicans were already suggesting that on the contrary, the plan does not go far enough or fully fund the pension system as quickly as they would like. but christine radogno, the state senate's republican leader, said in an interview, ""i really believe that it has become more of a political liability not to solve this than it is to solve it."" leaders on both sides of the aisle, she said, were busy counting votes and urging their rank-and-file members to support the plan.""this does set the state on sound financial footing,"" ms. radogno said. ""it doesn't erase the unfunded liability in one fell swoop, but it certainly puts us on a path to get it paid off in a minimum of 30 years.""among the provisions laid out friday: most pension matters would no longer be part of collective bargaining; some workers could choose to switch to a defined contribution system, like a 401(k, rather than their pension ; and workers would be asked to contribute 1 percent less of their salaries to retirement.but union leaders, representing some of the thousands of state employees, teachers outside of chicago and university workers whom the proposal would affect, said the changes to cost-of-living increases appear the most drastic. current workers would be asked to skip some increases to their pensions — as many as five times over a decade for the youngest among them.a new formula further limiting those increases would be devastating to many, the union leaders said. according to a coalition of unions, known as we are one illinois, the result would be a loss of thousands of dollars in pension payments, on average, to a retired teacher or nurse over the next five years.""if we're not successful in stopping this train, then our next step is litigation,"" said anders lindall of the american federation of state, county and municipal employees .",1990
sports,"with some n.f.l. teams out of contention and other (and better) teams potentially resting star players for the postseason, week 17 is always difficult to navigate from a fantasy perspective. it is not easy to predict which players will give your fantasy squad a full performance, which is why most fantasy football leagues play their championship games in week.but there are always a few stragglers who have a title on the line during the final week, and we believe no fantasy football owner should be left behind, so we are back for one last week of analysis. plus, with the growing popularity of the daily fantasy format, there will still be plenty of fans watching games this weekend from a fantasy perspective.in general, the key to succeeding in week 17 is to have a firm grasp on which teams still have something to play for, whether it's a playoff spot or a chance at a first-round bye or home-field advantage in the postseason. for the most part, you will want to stick with players who are on teams still in contention, so you can increase the chances of your players being on the field.along these lines, the detroit lions' matthew stafford has the best fantasy matchup for quarterbacks, against the minnesota vikings . but with detroit out of the postseason hunt, the team is likely to sit its injured star receiver, calvin johnson, striking a blow to stafford's fantasy value. regardless of that, stafford is difficult to trust this week based on his recent performance alone. he has averaged only 201 passing yards with a:5 touchdown-to-interception ratio over his last three games.stafford's situation shows that this week, more than any other, matchups are not everything in fantasy football . but they will still play a role for other players you may be considering in week.if you have a tough lineup question for week, check our complete player rankings. or, you can ask us on twitter . follow us at @5thdownfantasy. nick foles (phi) vs. dallas —- not surprisingly, foles was one of the better quarterback plays last weekend in the vast pool of fantasy football mediocrity. his fantastic regular season should end on a high note this weekend with plenty left to play for in a battle for the n.f.c. east with the cowboys, who rank as fantasy's second best quarterback matchup. cam newton (car) vs. atlanta — the panthers are fighting for a division title and a first-round bye, so newton is a safe start against the falcons, who have allowed 20 or more fantasy points to the position 11 times this season. newton tallied 20 fantasy points on atlanta in week. ben roethlisberger (pit) vs. cleveland — the steelers need a victory and a lot of help to clinch a playoff spot, but with a 1 p.m. eastern start, they will have only beating the browns on their mind, which is good news for fantasy's 10th best quarterback . roethlisberger has had only one game with fewer than 20 fantasy points over his last six games, and the rival browns have coughed up an average of 22 points to opposing quarterbacks over the last three games, and the 10th most total in.andrew luck (ind) vs. jacksonville — while the colts have their division wrapped up, a victory and some help will earn them a first-round bye . the jaguars have allowed an average of 25 fantasy points to opposing quarterbacks and the third most this year. luck will be at home under the dome for this one, so no weather concerns here.matt forte (chi) vs. green bay — the bears will certainly be looking to bounce back from sunday night's meltdown in philadelphia . in fact, they will have to if they want to win the division and secure a playoff spot. forte should rebound in a big way, especially since he totaled 125 yards rushing and a touchdown against the packers' 27th-ranked run defense in week.deangelo williams (car) vs. atlanta — williams has wracked up 34 fantasy points over his last two games and will be a recommended start against a weak falcons defense (seventh best rb matchup) as long as his backfield mate jonathan stewart continues to sit, which looks to be the case until the playoffs arrive.chris ivory (nyj) vs. miami — averaging.7 yards per carry over his last six games and coming off his third 100-yard game of the season, ivory is a strong rb2 play against the dolphins, who were just run over by the bills' backfield for 221 yards and a score last weekend (ninth best rb matchup. in what could be coach rex ryan's last game, do not expect the jets to roll over against their division rivals, who are fighting for a playoff spot.",1737

""this could have been a much greater tragedy.""all but one of the six victims lived in the apartment complex, a series of beige and yellow structures in a predominantly cuban residential neighborhood lined with oak trees. a man who lived across the street was killed as he arrived home with his two children. they were not injured.in all, four men and three women were killed, including the gunman, who had been holding the two hostages, a pakistani couple, according to neighbors, in the evacuated 96-unit apartment building when negotiations with a swat team broke down. the dead included a 17-year-old girl, identified by the associated press as priscila perez. the police said the other victims were the property managers, italo pisciotti, 79, and his wife, camira pisciotti, 69; the neighbor from across the street, carlos javier gavilanes, 33; patricio simono, 64; and merly s. niebles, 51. the gunman's mother was not present when he set fire to the apartment, the police said.shamira pisciotti, the managers' daughter, told wfor-tv, the cbs affiliate in miami, that there had been a complaint of some sort and that her parents had gone to check it out. ""i heard about 15 to 20 shots, and so i went outside, and my neighbors were screaming that my parents have been shot,"" ms. pisciotti told the television station . neighbors said they saw her crying shortly after the shooting erupted.other residents of the apartment complex said the barrage of gunfire had startled them from the peaceful dinnertime activities of a friday evening .""i'm used to seeing gunfire on tv,"" said pedro failde, 81, who lives in the building east of where the shootings occurred. ""but this was something else — boom, boom . it sounded like 10 shots from an ak.  i got away from the window very quickly.""mr. failde's companion, elizabeth villalobos, described the whole experience as ""terrible."" another resident, juan carlos arteaga, 51, said the shootings ""sounded like a war."" he led a reporter to a landing outside the gunman's apartment, where a charred doorway bore signs of the fire mr. vargas had apparently set.on a nearby landing, someone had set up a small shrine to the dead, with three candles in a glass, heart-shaped ashtray, surrounded by red roses.",1871
business,"boeing officials have detailed for the first time their proposed fixes for the lithium-ion batteries aboard its 787 planes, and the changes include better insulation between the eight cells in the battery, gentler charging to minimize stress and a new titanium venting system.but to prevent any new fire and smoke episodes like the ones that have grounded its fleet, boeing proposed the crudest tool in its considerable technological arsenal : the battery itself will be sealed inside a steel box that would serve as the last safety rampart if everything else fails. the federal aviation administration approved these changes on tuesday, and boeing has since begun a series of 20 certification tests that it expects to wrap up in one to two weeks. most of the tests will be conducted inside boeing labs, with only a single test flight planned since the plane's two batteries are not used while in normal flight.the 50 787s delivered to airlines so far have all been grounded since mid-january after two planes developed battery problems ; one battery ignited while a plane was parked in boston and another forced an emergency landing in japan when it began to smoke. with significant commercial and financial stakes in the balance, boeing is keen to rapidly resume passenger flights, though government officials have been more cautious about the timing.but the new safety features, made public late thursday, were an admission that despite its substantial resources, boeing might never determine what went wrong with the batteries . still, the changes are intended to reassure regulators and the public that the planes are safe and should be allowed to fly again soon.""this enclosure keeps us from ever having a fire in the beginning,"" mike sinnett, the 787's chief engineer, said during a news conference in japan along with ray conner, the president and chief executive of boeing's commercial airplane division. ""it eliminates the possibility for fire.""mr. sinnett said that boeing engineers had identified 80 different ways that the batteries could fail and modified the batteries as a result. but if, for whatever reason, a cell did overheat and combust, the steel casing would contain the smoke and fire, the venting tube would open, and the smoke would be pushed outside the plane instead of venting inside the cabin.donald r. sadoway, a materials chemistry professor at m.i.t., was not persuaded that boeing's plan went far enough. he said friday that the proposals seemed intended to mollify the f.a.a. to lift the grounding of the planes, but the approach seemed to focus more on dealing with a battery failure rather than preventing one. he pointed out that automakers had developed large-format lithium-ion batteries without encountering the problems boeing has had.""it doesn't have the look and feel that they are going to extreme measures to make sure this thing is robust,"" he said.the presence of senior boeing officials in japan reflected the central role that japanese companies have played in financing and manufacturing the planes. japanese authorities also need to approve boeing's new design.the lithium-ion battery is made in japan by gs yuasa, which mr. conner called ""a tremendous partner.""during the presentation, boeing also disputed characterizations made by the national transportation safety board in its investigation of the boston episode. the safety board has described it as a fire event that was caused when a failure in one cell cascaded to others, in what the board referred to as a thermal runaway. boeing executives took issue with both assertions, contending there never was a fire inside the battery . they pointed out that the only eyewitness report referred to two three-inch flames on the connectors outside the battery box. the second episode involved only smoke.in a report last week, the safety board said that firefighters reported ""radiant heat waves "" along with considerable smoke, but no flames, and one firefighter was burned in the neck when the battery exploded.in response, a safety board spokeswoman said the board stood by its report and would ""release only factual information as we are able to corroborate it.""boeing's stock closed at.43 on friday, up.14 percent.boeing's solution, which company officials call comprehensive and permanent, involves using the same battery cells and blue-box aluminum casing. the cells from the existing batteries will be retested and repurposed.the batteries' original insulation made of polyvinyl chloride, or pvc, can withstand heat of 300 degrees fahrenheit . instead, the cells will be wrapped with another insulating material called phenolic glass laminate, made of thin layers of a fiberglass material and resin, with a resistance of more than 900 degrees.boeing is also taking steps to reduce vibrations inside the battery that might have been one of the possible causes of the short circuits.the changes to the two batteries will add 150 pounds to the weight of the airplane — a small addition to the,000 pound jet — but enough to offset the weight advantage from using the lighter lithium-ion batteries in the first place.boeing said it had been testing its new system for the last six weeks and found that the steel casing could withstand three times the pressure generated when a battery suffered a catastrophic failure.""we think the likelihood of a repeat event is very unlikely,"" ron hinderberger, a senior boeing 787 engineer, said on a conference call on friday.",1127
business,"during and after the great recession, developed economies tended to fare worse than emerging ones, and that was shown in the amount of business going to manufacturers and service companies in various countries around the globe. but in the last few months, that tide has turned. companies in developed countries are more likely to be reporting growing business than are companies in emerging markets . the accompanying charts look at trends in the most prominent developing countries — brazil, russia, india and china, the so-called brics — and four major developed regions, the united states, britain, the euro zone and japan .they are based on the monthly surveys of companies taken by the institute for supply management in the united states and by markit in many other countries around the world. the surveys ask whether business is improving or getting worse, both over all and in a number of specific areas. the charts focus on the question of whether new orders are increasing or decreasing.in each case, a figure above 50 shows that more companies are reporting rising orders than are reporting falling orders, and the higher the number, the broader the rising order trend. similarly, figures below 50 indicate that a plurality of companies sees orders declining. figures above 60 show widespread growth in orders.for the first time in more than two years, the four developed regions shown in the graphic all reported rising orders for both manufacturing and service economies in august. there was still growth in some emerging markets, but indian and brazilian manufacturers reported falling orders in both july and august . the last period when both of those countries reported declines was march, at the bottom of the worldwide credit crisis .a simple way to compare the two groups is to average the four reported figures for developed countries and compare it to the average for the four emerging markets, which is done in the bottom chart. the developed-area advantage is the highest it has been since the great recession began in the united states in december.it is worth emphasizing that the figures are intended to show change, not the level of new orders. a company with booming business would presumably report a decline if the boom eased a little, while a struggling company could see a small gain from a low level .nonetheless, it is impressive that of the eight euro zone countries where surveys are taken of manufacturing companies, only france registered a figure under the neutral number of 50 in august, and that figure, at.8, was the best french manufacturers had posted in more than two years. even greece posted a positive figure, that first time that had happened in four years. germany's manufacturers, which reported order declines earlier this year, are again reporting increases.both the united states and britain had figures above 60 for new manufacturing orders. that had not happened since the spring of, when order books were still rebounding from the credit crisis . similarly, the slip in new business has extended to many other emerging markets . while chinese manufacturers reported a rise in new orders in august, the first such report in four months, the countries registering declines included taiwan, south korea, indonesia and vietnam . their manufacturing exports run the gamut, from inexpensive clothes in vietnam to cars and electronic products in korea.",1913
business,"i grew up in a small town, just northeast of scranton, pa. in the past 20 or so years, i've worked in buildings that had more people in them than my hometown. to say i don't like business travel would be a lie. it's a rush to fly someplace, and stay in a decent hotel . i'm like a child about it.i don't even get upset about delays and cancellations. i'm not that guy who is going to make a fuss. my trip isn't any more important than someone else's trip. so i just take it as it comes.one thing i still don't understand is frequent flier clubs. there's such a weird, almost elitist vibe in the clubs, even though some of them really aren't that much better than what you can find in most main airline terminals. people just ignore each other and don't seem to be enjoying themselves at all, in my experience.when i'm flying someplace for business, it's almost always domestic for our hgtv television shoots. i'm pretty old school and still dress up for flights, and usually wear a vest and dress pants.i was getting ready to sit down on one flight, and a woman asked me if i could help her with her carry-on. i said no problem. then she handed me some crumpled bags and a napkin.i took them, just because i didn't know what else to do. then i looked at myself, and realized that my navy blue vest, white shirt and gray pants looked like a uniform. she thought i was a male flight attendant .when you fly a lot, you know that almost anything can, and probably will, happen. i don't mind talking to seatmates at all, but i'll let them take the lead. seatmates on a recent flight from los angeles to new york city took getting to know their fellow passengers to a whole new level.i was seated in coach in the window seat. my middle seatmate was an attractive young woman probably in her 20s. about five minutes later, a guy in his 30s sat down in the aisle seat. it was a late evening flight, and everyone looked tired. i got myself situated and just looked over and smiled at them, and then stared out the window.the woman in the middle dozed off, and in the corner of my eye, it appeared that she was leaning her head against the guy in the aisle seat. he was asleep, too. i figured they were a couple traveling together, and i thought, ""how sweet."" but i also thought it was kind of strange that they didn't talk at all before takeoff.when the flight crew made an announcement, the two were roused awake and began a very quiet conversation. and then they started to kiss, and they kept on kissing. it was kind of ridiculous, and very uncomfortable, but i wasn't going to say anything. after all, they seemed to be a couple in love. they finally stopped kissing, and started holding hands.the plane began its descent, and the female part of the equation turned to the guy and asked him, ""is this your final destination, or are you connecting?"" as the brief conversation continued, it was very clear they weren't a couple. they didn't even know each other before the flight.once the plane landed, the woman was completely uninterested in this guy. she made a swift exit out of our row, and the guy was just left sitting there looking very disappointed.i just mumbled, ""excuse me,"" as i made out my way out of the row. saying, ""sorry, buddy,"" just seemed like rubbing salt in the wound.",1734
arts,"early in "" the act of killing,"" joshua oppenheimer's startling new documentary about mass murder and impunity in indonesia, a death squad leader named anwar congo, dapper in white pants and a lime-green shirt, demonstrates how he strangled hundreds of people with wire. it was quicker and less messy than beating them to death, he explains matter-of-factly, then breaks into a dance routine, performing the cha cha cha for the camera.""the act of killing,"" which opens on friday, is crammed with unsettlingly bizarre moments like that, blending the horrific and the absurd in a disturbing cocktail. time after time, the killers joke and brag about their deeds, which earns them applause on an indonesian tv talk show, praise from officials in the government in power today and condemnation from the human rights groups that want to see them brought to justice .but mr. oppenheimer's film, which counts werner herzog and errol morris as its executive producers and was made by a largely indonesian crew, is also stirring controversy because of its unorthodox form. re-enactments are always a source of disagreement in the documentary world, but mr. oppenheimer has taken that longstanding debate to a new level by encouraging the perpetrators of human rights abuses to restage their crimes, on film and for a global audience.""i think it's our obligation as filmmakers, as people investigating the world, to create the reality that is most insightful to the issues at hand,"" mr. oppenheimer, 38, said in a recent interview. ""here are human beings, like us, boasting about atrocities that should be unimaginable. and the question is: why are they doing this? for whom are they doing this? what does it mean to them? how do they want to be seen? how do they see themselves? and this method was a way of answering those questions.""the events initially addressed in ""the act of killing"" are little known in the west : the slaughter of as many as a million people in indonesia following the military's seizure of power there in. the victims were labeled communists but included labor leaders, ethnic chinese and intellectuals, with paramilitary groups carrying out the killings at the behest of the indonesian army and with the support of the united states and its allies, who worried that indonesia, like vietnam, would fall into communist hands.in indonesia, the killings were ""a kind of open secret, kept discreetly hidden so that if you wanted to, you could pretend it wasn't happening,"" said john roosa, a scholar of indonesian history at the university of british columbia and the author of ""pretext for mass murder,"" the leading book about the 1965 massacres . ""so this film has become a provocation, an impetus for indonesians to go back to the perpetrators and say, 'tell us exactly what happened.' ""organized killings occurred all across indonesia, the world's fourth most-populous country, but mr. oppenheimer focuses on medan, a large city in northern sumatra. there a group of so-called "" movie gangsters,"" fans of john wayne and marlon brando, as well as of mafia and american b- movies, did much of the killing, inspired in part by the films they loved.mr. congo, the focus of the documentary, tells of seeing an elvis presley movie, then skipping across the street, ""still in the mood of the film,"" to the roof of the building where he would garrote his victims. ""it was like we were killing happily,"" he tells mr. oppenheimer.born in texas, educated at harvard and now based in europe, mr. oppenheimer is a constant presence in ""the act of killing,"" always outside the frame but asking questions of the killers in their native tongue, which he picked up working on films like ""the globalisation tapes,"" and being addressed by them. he said the decision to stage the re-enactments emerged as a logical extension of his initial interviews with some 40 death squad members. they had a natural theatricality, he said, which led him to offer to underwrite and film their re-enactments of their deeds. the killers did not get a salary but were paid what mr. oppenheimer called a ""modest per diem"" (approved by the university of westminster and the british arts and humanities research council, which financed the re-enactments.""within minutes of meeting me, they would tell me horrible stories, often boastfully, and would say, 'how about if we go to the place where i killed people, and i will show you how i did it?' "" he recalled. ""and then they would often lament afterwards, 'oh i should have brought a machete along to use as a prop,' or 'i should have brought friends along who could play victims, it would have been more cool that way.' ""given free rein, the death squad members molded their performances to fit their favorite film genres. one scene was staged as a western, with mr. congo and his comically portly sidekick, herman koto, wearing cowboy hats, while others were done as film noir or horror.

science,"as lawmakers in washington continue to wrangle over nasa's financing and expeditions, a top administrator at the agency who played a large role in drafting the obama administration's controversial space policies is bowing out.lori b. garver, nasa's deputy administrator for the past four years, will leave next month to take the top staff position at the air line pilots association, a union representing,000 pilots in the united states and canada .""it's time to take on new challenges,"" ms. garver said in an interview on tuesday. ""i feel like i've accomplished so many of the objectives i set out to do here.""ms. garver, 52, who works at nasa headquarters in washington, was often the public face — and lightning rod for criticism — of the obama administration's efforts to push nasa in new directions. the white house wanted to cancel the program started under president george w . bush to send astronauts back to the moon, and scale back the agency's role in designing rockets and spacecraft.ms. garver, who previously worked both inside and outside of nasa, served as an adviser to hillary rodham clinton's 2008 presidential campaign . she switched to mr. obama's team after he won the nomination, and following the election she played a central role on the transition team for shaping nasa policy. in july, the senate confirmed ms. garver's appointment as nasa deputy administrator.""she has been an indispensable partner in our efforts to keep nasa on a trajectory of progress and innovation,"" the nasa administrator, maj. gen. charles f. bolden jr., wrote in an e-mail to nasa employees. ""in a time of great change and challenge, she has been a remarkable leader who has consistently shown great vision and commitment to nasa and the aerospace industry .""ms. garver advocated a greater for role for ""new space"" — the involvement of entrepreneurial companies, which many space advocates say they believe are more nimble and efficient than aerospace titans like boeing and lockheed martin that nasa has traditionally relied on.""the main goal was really to align nasa in a way that allowed them to be more sustainable and innovative in the 21 st century,"" she said.however, some of the proposals received a cool, sometimes hostile, reception in washington . members of congress in both parties complained that the plans often did not seem fully thought out, and that the administration did a poor job of explaining — to the agency, lawmakers, contractors and the general public — nasa's new mission.in its 2011 budget proposal, the obama administration sought to cancel the moon program and take a five-year hiatus on any development of rockets or spacecraft capable of taking astronauts beyond low-earth orbit to more distant destinations like the moon, asteroids or mars. ms. garver and other nasa officials argued that devoting the rocket money to more fundamental space technologies would actually speed future human exploration of the solar system.both democrats and republicans were unconvinced and directed nasa to build a huge new rocket, now known as the space launch system, and a capsule, known as orion, where astronauts would live during their excursions into deep space. the first flight with humans is scheduled for, but so far, no consensus has emerged on where the new spacecraft should take nasa astronauts.""one of the legacies has been the decline and deterioration of relationships between the white house and congress over the direction of space policy,"" said scott pace, director of the space policy institute at george washington university and a space adviser to the 2012 republican presidential candidate mitt romney . ""she was part of it. i don't put sole blame on her. she was one of the more visible faces of that.""however, the administration did achieve several of its other goals, including turning to the private sector to provide transportation for astronauts going to and from the international space station . in the past, nasa designed and operated its spacecraft like the space shuttle, and it was a major cultural change within the agency to rely more on outsiders.""it was critical to reduce the cost of getting to and from space,"" ms. garver said. the effort, known as commercial crew, has nasa financing attempts by three commercial companies — boeing, space exploration technologies corporation and sierra nevada corporation — and she said it is ""clearly a goal that is now well, well established on its way."" officials also persuaded congress to provide money for next-generation technologies like new propulsion systems and in-space fueling stations for spacecraft.""i am not embarrassed at all by compromise,"" ms. garver said. ""that is something that this country can probably do a little more of these days.""during the past few months, ms. garver has been advocating a proposal to capture a small asteroid and bring it into orbit around the moon for exploration by astronauts. nasa officials say the effort would have possible important side effects, like advancing ways to find asteroids with the potential to collide with earth. they also say the robotic spacecraft that would capture the asteroid would demonstrate propulsion and solar cell technology that could later be deployed for a human mission to mars, and the asteroid would provide an interesting destination for the astronauts on the first space launch system mission in.that proposal, too, has been met skeptically, with republicans in the house of representatives disliking it so much that they are seeking to explicitly prohibit nasa from pursuing it. they instead would like to revive the moon as the next destination for nasa astronauts.ms. garver expressed some frustration that some in congress want nasa to build the new rocket, but are not willing to let the space agency figure out how best to use it. ""it is disappointing where there is just an unwillingness to look at things on their merit,"" she said. ""we have put together a mission concept that really does take advantage of the very vehicle that congress has funded for us to build.""",1187
business,"washington (ap) — the number of americans seeking unemployment benefits fell last week to a seasonally adjusted,000, the second-fewest in more than five years. the drop in jobless claims suggests that layoffs have declined and that job growth may pick up from last month's sluggish pace.applications for benefits dropped,000, the labor department said thursday . the four-week average declined,500 to,500. jobless claims are a proxy for layoffs. when they decline, it signals that companies are cutting fewer jobs .still, layoffs are only half the equation. businesses also need to be confident enough in the economy to step up hiring . many companies have been advertising more jobs but have been slow to fill them. job openings jumped 11 percent during the 12 months that ended in february, but the number of people hired declined, according to a labor department report this month.the still-uncertain economy has made many companies reluctant to hire. some employers appear to be holding out for perfect job candidates . in particular, companies say they cannot find enough qualified candidates for high-skilled manufacturing and engineering jobs .still, most economists were encouraged by thursday's report on unemployment benefits, though some cautioned against reading too much into one week's data. ""the downtrend in unemployment remains on track,"" said jim o'sullivan, chief united states economist at high frequency economics .in march, employers added only,000 jobs . that was a sharp drop from the previous four months, when hiring averaged,000 a month. the unemployment rate fell to a four-year low of.6 percent in march from.7 percent in february. but the drop occurred because more people out of work stopped looking for jobs . the government does not count people as unemployed unless they are actively looking for work.more than five million americans received unemployment aid in the week ending april, the latest data available. that is about,000 fewer than the previous week . some recipients may no longer receive benefits because they have found jobs . but many have used up all the benefits available to them.the economy is expected to have grown at a much quicker pace in the january-march quarter, and the government will give its first estimate on growth in the nation's gross domestic product on friday. many economists forecast that growth accelerated to an annual rate of more than 3 percent in the first quarter, up from just a.4 percent rate in the fourth quarter .",727
sports,"augusta, ga. — in golf, and almost no other sport, interactive, real-time communication between armchair television viewers and referees supervising the competition routinely changes rulings and alters the outcomes of tournaments . this collaboration of living room second-guessers and rules officials is an almost weekly occurrence. on saturday, it embroiled the masters, golf's biggest event, in a controversy that involved the game's most celebrated player, tiger woods . woods, who had been three strokes off the lead, was assessed a two-stroke penalty saturday for hitting from the wrong spot on friday, a violation first flagged by a television viewer. woods could have been disqualified from the masters, but officials instead invoked a rarely applied two-year-old rule that spares offending players in exceptional cases.the catalyst for the rules controversy began with a short and simple text message .a friend of a rules official saw something on television that looked improper, an illegal drop by woods after his ball plunked into a pond at the 15th hole. masters officials would not reveal the identity of the texter, but the claim was brought before the masters rules committee, which decided there was no violation. then, about an hour later, woods inadvertently implicated himself, saying that before dropping the ball he had taken two steps back, which was not permitted under the circumstances.the process for saturday's ruling might have been especially delicate; removing woods from the masters could have ruined tv ratings and deprived the world's top-ranked player of his best chance in several years to win his 15th major championship .but masters officials said neither woods's popularity nor his pursuit of history was a factor. they had absolved him of wrongdoing on friday; a day later, they said they could not impose the harsh penalty that goes with signing an incorrect scorecard — disqualification — because their earlier decision mitigated his culpability.unheard-of in other sports, communication between viewers and tournament officials happens nearly every week on the professional golf tours.at the masters, officials said hundreds of viewers contacted the club with suspected rules infractions. most often, they call the club, whose phone number is easy to find on the internet .""there are a lot of people out there that know a lot about the rules, or think they know a lot about the rules,"" said fred ridley, the masters chairman for competition committees . ""it creates more work for us, but we do look at every one of these.""the defending masters champion, bubba watson, said saturday that pga tour players were approached about viewer-generated rules investigations so frequently it was shrugged off in the players' locker room .""our sport is the only one you'd ever allow viewers to do that,"" watson said. ""they're definitely not calling about missed balls and strikes during a baseball game or if someone's getting away with holding during a football game.""asked why it happens in golf, watson answered, ""maybe it's because our sport is so slow, people have time to call."" television viewers also routinely have more than one phone number to call. many try contacting the network broadcasting the event. many go directly to the united states golf association because it oversees the rules of golf in this country. and others contact the pga tour itself, whose phone number is easily found.""they must have a lot of time on their hands,"" watson said. ""because i don't know the phone number to call, and i'm playing in the golf tournament .""at augusta national golf club, which hosts the masters, any rules infraction phone call coming through the main switchboard is sent to the tournament headquarters office.the details of the call are recorded and documented with the specifics of the suspected violation scrupulously noted and then passed on to the masters rules committee . each case is investigated, which can involve interviewing the player or players involved, until the situation is resolved as groundless or worthy of a penalty. ""the players are under a microscope, and people watch their golf closely,"" ridley said. ""and when they contact us, we make a determination.""the history of television whistle-blowers in golf goes back at least 25 years. at the 1987 san diego open, craig stadler, a masters winner, was in contention during the third round when he knelt on a towel to hit a shot from under a tree on the 14th hole.he was trying to keep his pants clean, but multiple viewers phoned the tournament press room to report he had illegally ""built a stance,"" to use the terminology in golf's rule book. stadler was not informed about the rules accusations until sunday, after he had posted a score that would have been good for third place. instead, he was disqualified for signing an incorrect scorecard after the saturday round.through the years, various infractions have been noticed by viewers: golfers illegally removing impediments, touching their clubs in the sand of bunkers or accidentally hitting a competitor's ball instead of their own.other major sports do not have a system in place that would allow viewers at home to contact the ruling authorities and point out overlooked transgressions.but in golf, which is largely policed by players who routinely call penalties on themselves, the interloping armchair referee is welcomed, or at least listened to. looking the other way when a rule is breached would be considered offensive to the game's integrity, as well as the sense that golf is governed by an unseen karma known as the rub of the green.a case in point might have occurred last month at the l.p.g.a. event in scottsdale, ariz. stacy lewis was assessed a two-stroke penalty after a television viewer spotted her caddie testing the surface of a bunker in the third round. lewis was approached about the possible infraction before signing her scorecard. after watching a replay, she signed for a 68 instead of a.during the next day's final round, lewis overcame a four-stroke deficit to win the tournament and was crowned the world's no. 1-ranked player.",989
sports,"it was in california in the midst of a promising but not yet fully realized season that jelena jankovic had a heart-to-heart talk with her backhand down the line. jankovic, the serbian tennis star, who was ranked no.1 in the world in, was trying to furnish her new house near san diego and was having difficulty digesting the price of the window treatment she wanted to purchase.""i always have joked that my backhand down the line was the shot that paid my bills,"" jankovic said. ""and i was like, this thing has to start working again, otherwise i can't get my curtains and buy some new sofas and finish my house.""the backhand and everything else have worked well enough for jankovic, 28, to make an unexpected return to the game's elite.after slipping to 22 in the world rankings at the end of last season, she was still heading in the wrong direction early this year.""i was almost going to drop out of the top 30 at some point in february,"" she recalled.but after hiring her older brother marko, 34, as her coach and winning a title later that month on clay in bogot, she shifted the momentum. now, after a run to the final at the top- tier event in beijing this month — where she lost in straight sets to serena williams — she is back at no.8 and back, after a two-year absence, in the eight-player field for the w.t.a. tour championships that begins on tuesday in istanbul.""if i'm honest, i would not think she can finish in the championships,"" said petra kvitova, the czech player who also has qualified and who lost to jankovic in beijing . ""but she's a former no.1, so we always know she's a great player. that happens in tennis — it's a lot of ups and downs . she has a great backhand down the line. she's different to other players and she's a good mover, so it's tough to finish the point. so i think she's back."" jankovic remains a former no.1 without a grand slam singles title, but, all too accustomed to answering questions about her former ranking, she says she is at peace with her place in the game and particularly content after her resurgence.""yes, i was no.1 in the world in the past, but i think when you look at where i've been — i was outside the top 20 — so i think i'm very happy and proud of myself that i was able to come back into the top and make that step forward,"" she said. ""i think a lot of players do well but once they drop they never come back."" jankovic attributes her fall out of the top 10 to injuries, a loss of belief and some fitness-training errors, including the decision to lift weights and bulk up in a quest for power, a move that she says cost her some of her trademark speed. a fluid counter-puncher who is nearly as elastic as her compatriot novak djokovic, she seemed to have become too defensive.""i think it was more of a confidence thing; i wasn't confident in my shots, and i didn't feel comfortable playing and made a lot of errors,"" she said. ""i wasn't too successful whatever i was doing, so i had to make changes and try to get back on track.""she considers hiring her brother one of her best moves.""he started playing tennis first, and i started playing tennis because of him when i was 9 and a half years old,"" she said. ""and so, you know, i always wanted to be like my brother when i was younger and to do what he did. but afterward he stopped and went to study in university.""""i've had a few coaches last year and the year before and did not find the right match,"" she added, ""and i think that my brother knows me best, knows my game best, knows my character and knows me as a person, what i like and don't like. and we are very close with each other. he's my blood. and i think, honestly, who's going to wish me better than my brother?""for most of her career, jankovic traveled with her mother, snezana, but she said her parents were now spending more time at home together off the road in serbia.""just leading a normal life,"" jankovic said. ""it's a lot of time on the road, in the planes, in the hotel . it's not an easy lifestyle, and for me, i've got to be fair. she has to stay at home with my dad. there are other parts of the family, not only me.""",1514
politics,"washington — for much of the last decade, senator charles e . schumer 's job was to bury republicans, as one of his party's most ruthless strategists and tireless fund-raisers . it was a job he did so effectively that he was asked to do it twice.but to watch mr. schumer operate these days, it would seem he has managed to get some republicans to forget. there are now regular early-morning chats on immigration reform with marco rubio in the senate gym. there was the excursion last week to the mexican border with john mccain, who after learning that their visit would fall during passover offered, ""i'll bring the latkes.""just this week, mr. schumer spent a good deal of time on the phone with tom coburn of oklahoma, one of the senate's most unyielding conservatives, trying to keep the door open to a deal that would expand background checks for all gun sales.no one in the senate right now has a legislative portfolio thicker than mr. schumer's, and no one's political fortunes are as closely linked to the outcome of the major public policy fights now consuming congress .he is not only a whisperer to republicans but also an envoy to the white house and a trusted confidant to the majority leader, harry reid of nevada, who having handpicked mr. schumer to keep republicans in the minority is now counting on him as his most important bipartisan bridge builder.""i give him a lot of leeway,"" mr. reid said in an interview, noting that he had personally asked mr. schumer to take a leading role on gun control and immigration legislation . ""i don't know what we're going to end up with. but he has taken the ball, and he is running with it.""if congress passes comprehensive legislation on either of these issues, few lawmakers will be able to claim more credit than mr. schumer . he would add to his résumé a significant achievement that could make it easier to attain what colleagues believe is his ultimate goal after mr. reid steps aside: the majority leader's post.but if these efforts fail, few will shoulder more of the blame.""i'm happy where i am, and in no hurry,"" he said in a recent interview when asked about his leadership ambitions. ""i'm a hard-working, hard-charging fella. and sometimes leaders would be afraid of that. harry wasn't. he wanted to harness and utilize my talents.""he is now the no. 3 senate democrat, a leadership post he earned after the first of two successful stints as the head of the democratic senatorial campaign committee . he was known for dipping into his own accounts to distribute millions to fellow democrats in tough re- election fights, and he still flies around the country to raise money for his colleagues, tapping his reliable sources of campaign money .today he stands on stage at news conferences with many of the same republicans he sought to defeat. during president obama's state of the union address in february, he and mr. mccain were side by side with senators kirsten e. gillibrand, democrat of new york, and lindsey graham, republican of south carolina, their fellow immigration overhaul advocates. they secured seats just a few feet from the rostrum so the president would see them. (as recently as last year, mr. mccain grumbled to fox news, ""i have never seen senator schumer address any issue unless it was political."")mr. schumer has heaped praise on mr. rubio as ""daniel in the lion's den"" for supporting immigration changes that make many conservatives wary. he has called mr. mccain ""the glue"" in the immigration talks and lauded him for ""his wisdom, his strength, his courage.""he has affirmed his respect for mr. coburn, ""a person of integrity,"" in his words.but not all republicans take such a welcoming approach to mr. schumer, chief among them senator mitch mcconnell of kentucky, the republican leader . mr. mcconnell has blamed mr. schumer for an ad from 2008 — the year he was up for re- election — that hit republicans for voting for the bank bailout, a position that mr. schumer and most other senate democrats took themselves.recently mr. schumer has tried to mend fences. earlier this year when mr. mcconnell's university of louisville played syracuse in basketball, mr. schumer invited his adversary to attend the game with him. citing a scheduling conflict, mr. mcconnell declined. but if syracuse and louisville advance to the n.c.a.a. finals next week, the ever-persistent mr. schumer has said, he will ask the kentuckian to watch with him in washington .if his position at the nexus of the major legislative debates of the day rankles some republicans, it strikes others as natural. policy, colleagues say, was always his indulgence.""when an issue would hit, the first guy out there talking about it was chuck,"" said representative peter t. king, a long island republican . ""the first guy with a piece of legislation was chuck. and sometimes when something wasn't even an issue, chuck was out there talking about it.""with a jammed schedule these days, mr. schumer, 62, gallops through the halls of the capitol, bolting from one meeting to the next with his flip phone glued to his ear. it is not an antisocial way of avoiding people, he insists. he simply has no other way to communicate away from the office because his phone is so outdated it lacks internet access .""usually the first call i get at home in the morning is schumer,"" mr. reid said. ""the last call i get at night: schumer .""he is viewed less and less as the spotlight-stealing self-promoter about whom bob dole once quipped that the most dangerous place in washington is between him and a camera. senator edward m. kennedy would not even acknowledge him by name at first, though they later became good friends. ""he'd point to me,"" mr. schumer recalled fondly.these days the president takes his call.""i used to have to sort of make excuses to see him,"" mr. schumer said. nowadays? ""not so much.""mr. schumer served as head of the joint congressional committee that oversaw the inauguration in january, an assignment that came with the perk of riding with mr. obama from the white house to the capitol before the swearing-in. and during those 15 precious minutes, mr. schumer gave the president some advice.if you want your agenda to succeed, come to us, he said. ""the senate ought to be the caldron to start things out,"" mr. schumer recalled saying.the next day his chief of staff asked him which was more fun: the inauguration or his own bar mitzvah ?the inauguration, hands down, he said. never one to miss an opening for a personal anecdote, he elaborated. his bar mitzvah fell on nov. 23, 1963, the day after john f. kennedy was assassinated. but he and his family went ahead with it anyway only to find their synagogue full of mourners — a much larger crowd than a very nervous young chuck had expected or wanted.these days, few would accuse senator schumer of being so reluctant about taking center stage .",1203
science,"bunnies, dragons and the 'normal' world: the normal distribution crops up many places in nature. the central limit theorem explains how it provides a near-universal expectation for averages of measurements.statistics are used to describe the world. the average height of women in the united states, for example, is.8 inches. statistics are also used to test our ideas. if your friend told you he is 130 pounds, and you also know that 98 percent of healthy adult males weigh more than this, you might have reason to be concerned about his health. this is because you would expect few men sampled at random from the healthy population to weigh this little.many common statistical tests are possible because we can compare new observations to expected patterns, as above. but what is the expected pattern? if our expectation is wrong, we could reach incorrect conclusions.many real-world observations can be approximated by, and tested against, the same expected pattern: the normal distribution . in this familiar symmetric bell-shaped pattern, most observations are close to average, and there are fewer observations further from the average. the size of flowers, the physiological response to a drug, the breaking force in a batch of steel cables — these and other observations often fit a normal distribution .there are, however, many important things we would like to measure and test that do not follow a normal distribution . household income doesn't — high values are much further from the average than low values are.but even when raw data does not fit a normal distribution, there is often a normal distribution lurking within it. this makes it possible to still use the normal distribution to test ideas about non-normal data. this hidden normal distribution is revealed by collecting samples of multiple observations, and calculating the average for each sample. as the number of observations in each sample increases, the distribution of these averages becomes more and more similar to the normal distribution . the existence of this hidden normal distribution is known as the central limit theorem.in this episode of creaturecast, shuyi chiou, an animator, presents the central limit theorem. and, for the record, dragons do not exist. the song is franz danzi's ""wind quintet op. 67 no. 3 in e-flat major, 4 allegretto,"" performed by the soni ventorum wind quintet. further work by ms. chiou can be found at her web site, shuyichiou.blogspot.com.more animations and images can be found at nytimes.com/ creaturecast and creaturecast .org, a project supported in part by the national science foundation .",783
science,"""leadership tomorrow depends on how we educate our students today — especially in science, technology, engineering and math,"" president obama has declared. while the words may be new, the sentiment goes back a long way.as michael wysession, an earth and planetary scientist at washington university in st . louis, wrote this year in the online edition of scientific american. ""though we live in a thoroughly modern scientific world, our science education structure is now 120 years old."" the debate is nothing new, either; here and elsewhere in this issue are some historic highlights.early american education takes many cues from older systems in europe, particularly their emphasis on so-called project-based learning. one of the tools in use are froebel blocks, invented by friedrich fröbel (""the father of the modern kindergarten movement, which teaches students basic math, including geometry, and building skills. frank lloyd wright is said to have used these blocks and other froebel toys as a child, playtime which may have influenced his modernist architecture.the national education association, through its committee of ten, issues a report that, in part, recommends the expansion of science education in elementary and secondary schools . the committee is headed by charles eliot, the president of harvard university, who is also seen as largely responsible for bringing laboratory science to the university. thought by many to be the formal beginnings of science and math education on the elementary and secondary levels, the report is spurred by america's shift from an agrarian society to a more industrial one. the committee's recommendations go on to persist through the 1930s, and some are still in practice today. world war ii refocuses much science education into fields like aviation, electricity and nuclear physics. in 1942 the westinghouse electric and manufacturing company sponsors its first science talent search, a national fair now known as the intel science talent search that awards scholarship money for independent science projects by high school students. these fairs prove very popular, and now there are other fairs sponsored by siemens and, most recently, google .russia launches the sputnik 1 satellite, an event widely recognized as galvanizing. deeply embarrassed at being beaten in the cold war space race, american leaders double financing for the national science foundation, which supports teacher training and curriculum development. many new textbooks explicitly emphasize space exploration .",1860
business,"detroit — despite steady profits, last year was a rocky one for general motors, raising questions about the strength of the company's comeback from its bankruptcy and government bailout .g.m., the nation's biggest automaker, posted its lowest united states market share in decades, searched for answers to its longstanding troubles in europe and struggled to overcome the lingering, politically charged stigma of being "" government motors.""on wednesday, g.m.'s chief executive, daniel akerson, acknowledged that the company still had a long way to go before it completed its turnaround. but he said that a host of promising new products should help it gain traction this year.""this is going to be a strong year for product introductions, not only in north america, but around the globe,"" mr. akerson said in a briefing with reporters at g.m.'s headquarters. ""in 2013 and ', the sun will be at our backs.""in, the company's share of the united states market sank to.9 percent, down from.6 percent the year before. it was the company's lowest market share in more than 50 years.and while the overall american market grew.4 percent last year, g.m.'s sales increased just.7 percent. by contrast, toyota and honda rebounded sharply from supply disruptions caused by the 2011 earthquake and tsunami in japan, and rivals like chrysler and volkswagen made big sales gains .""it was a very mediocre year for g.m.,"" said rebecca lindland, an analyst at the research firm ihs automotive . ""they are still kind of finding their way postbankruptcy.""mr. akerson, 64, said he expected g.m. to make ""modest"" market-share improvements this year, as it refreshes its showrooms with 13 new products, including redesigned versions of its chevrolet and gmc pickup trucks .""what you'll see is a g.m. that is projecting some confidence and some vigor,"" he said.that description has hardly applied to g.m. since it was forced into bankruptcy in 2009 by the obama administration as a condition for the final portions of its.5 billion government bailout .the company emerged as a smaller, leaner competitor with fewer brands, employees and factories, and a revamped management team led by mr. akerson, a government-appointed board member who took over as chief executive in the fall of.since its bankruptcy, g.m. has had some success introducing new cars in the united states, like the chevrolet cruze and the cadillac ats. it has also continued to grow in china .in addition, the company has reduced its pension overhang by buying out some salaried workers and transferring its long-term obligations to the rest of the white-collar work force to an outside insurance firm .g.m. also received good news last month when the treasury department agreed to sell 200 million of the g.m. shares owned by taxpayers back to the company and pledged to sell its remaining 300 million shares by early.""i think it's important for that chapter to close on that part of our history,"" mr. akerson said.g.m. is expected to report healthy earnings this month for the fourth quarter of, which would be its 12th straight profitable quarter. but it is still losing considerable money in europe, where the economic downturn has depressed vehicle sales for several automakers .the company has forecast that its 2012 losses in europe will be at least.5 billion. mr. akerson said he hoped the losses could be trimmed by one-third this year, but reiterated that g.m.'s european operations would not break even until mid-decade.he said there were no new plans for job cuts or factory closings on the continent although the company planned to continue whittling down costs there. ""we are taking out cost structure intelligently, more with a scalpel than a knife,"" he said.mr. akerson said that the company's finances had improved and that he hoped it would be able to shed its junk credit rating this year and return to an investment-grade rating, which would allow it to reduce its borrowing costs .but he was circumspect when discussing his own future. a former executive with the carlyle group, a private equity firm, he declined to put a timetable on his tenure as g.m.'s chief.""i think i will be here next year at this time,"" he said. ""but i don't know how long that will run.""in the short term, mr. akerson said he hoped g.m. could generate excitement for its new products next week at the industry's big annual trade show in detroit .the company is set to unveil a coming redesign of its corvette sports car, as well as a cadillac version of its volt plug-in hybrid . consumers will also get their first look at the new pickups, which are scheduled to have their debut later this year.the auto show spotlight could become a turning point in the public's perception of g.m., said ms. lindland of ihs.""the reality is that this company still has many challenges ahead,"" she said.

science,"washington — lately, the jet stream isn't playing by the rules. scientists say that big river of air high above earth that dictates much of the weather for the northern hemisphere has been unusually erratic the past few years .they blame it for everything from snowstorms in may to the path of superstorm sandy .and last week, it was responsible for downpours that led to historic floods in alberta, canada, as well as record-breaking heat in parts of alaska, experts say. the town of mcgrath, alaska, hit. just a few weeks earlier, the same spot was 15 degrees.the current heat wave in the northeast is also linked. ""while it's not unusual to have a heat wave in the east in june, it is part of the anomalous jet stream pattern that was responsible for the flooding in alberta,"" rutgers university climate scientist jennifer francis said tuesday in an email.the jet stream usually rushes rapidly from west to east in a mostly straight direction. but lately it's been wobbling and weaving like a drunken driver, wreaking havoc as it goes. the more the jet stream undulates north and south, the more changeable and extreme the weather .it's a relatively new phenomenon that scientists are still trying to understand. some say it's related to global warming ; others say it's not.in may, there was upside-down weather : early california wildfires fueled by heat contrasted with more than a foot of snow in minnesota . seattle was the hottest spot in the nation one day, and maine and edmonton, canada, were warmer than miami and phoenix .consider these unusual occurrences over the past few years :— the winter of 2011-12 seemed to disappear, with little snow and record warmth in march. that was followed by the winter of 2012-13 when nor'easters seemed to queue up to strike the same coastal areas repeatedly.— superstorm sandy took an odd left turn in october from the atlantic straight into new jersey, something that happens once every 700 years or so.— one 12-month period had a record number of tornadoes . that was followed by 12 months that set a record for lack of tornadoes .and here is what federal weather officials call a ""spring paradox: the u.s. had both an unusually large area of snow cover in march and april and a near- record low area of snow cover in may. the entire northern hemisphere had record snow coverage area in december but the third lowest snow extent for may.""i've been doing meteorology for 30 years and the jet stream the last three years has done stuff i've never seen,"" said jeff masters, meteorology director at the private service weather underground. ""the fact that the jet stream is unusual could be an indicator of something. i'm not saying we know what it is.""rutgers' francis is in the camp that thinks climate change is probably playing a role in this.""it's been just a crazy fall and winter and spring all along, following a very abnormal sea ice condition in the arctic,"" francis said, noting that last year set a record low for summer sea ice in the arctic. ""it's possible what we're seeing in this unusual weather is all connected.""other scientists don't make the sea ice and global warming connections that francis does. they see random weather or long-term cycles at work. and even more scientists are taking a wait-and-see approach about this latest theory. it's far from a scientific consensus, but it is something that is being studied more often and getting a lot of scientific buzz.""there are some viable hypotheses,"" stanford university climate scientist noah diffenbaugh said. ""we're going to need more evidence to fully test those hypotheses.""the jet stream, or more precisely the polar jet stream, is the one that affects the northern hemisphere . it dips down from alaska, across the united states or canada, then across the atlantic and over europe and ""has everything to do with the weather we experience,"" francis said.it all starts with the difference between cold temperatures in the arctic and warmer temperatures in the mid-latitudes, she explained. the bigger the temperature difference, the stronger the jet stream, the faster it moves and the straighter it flows. but as the northern polar regions warm two to three times faster than the rest of the world, augmented by unprecedented melting of arctic sea ice and loss in snow cover, the temperature difference shrinks. then the jet stream slows and undulates more.the jet stream is about 14 percent slower in the fall now than in the 1990s, according to a recent study by francis. and when it slows, it moves north-south instead of east-west, bringing more unusual weather, creating blocking patterns and cutoff lows that are associated with weird weather, the rutgers scientist said.mike halpert, the deputy director of noaa's climate prediction center, said that recently the jet stream seems to create weather patterns that get stuck, making dry spells into droughts and hot days into heat waves .take the past two winters. they were as different as can be, but both had unusual jet stream activity. normally, the jet stream plunges southwest from western washington state, sloping across to alabama . then it curves slightly out to sea around the outer banks, a swoop that's generally straight without dramatic bends.during the mostly snowless winter of 2011-12 and the record warm march, the jet stream instead formed a giant upside-down u, curving dramatically in the opposite direction . that trapped warm air over much of the eastern u.s. a year later the jet stream was again unusual, this time with a sharp u-turn north . this trapped colder and snowier weather in places like chicago and caused nor'easters in new england, francis said.but for true extremes, nothing beats tornadoes .in, the united states was hit over and over by killer twisters . from june 2010 to may 2011 the u.s. had a record number of substantial tornadoes, totaling,050. then just a year later came a record tornado drought. from may 2012 to april 2013 there were only 217 tornadoes — 30 fewer than the old record, said harold brooks, a meteorologist at the national severe storms laboratory. brooks said both examples were related to unusual jet stream patterns.last fall, a dip in the jet stream over the united states and northward bulge of high pressure combined to pull superstorm sandy almost due west into new jersey, francis said. that track is so rare and nearly unprecedented that computer models indicate it would happen only once every 714 years, according to a new study by nasa and columbia university scientists.""everyone would agree that we are in a pattern"" of extremes, noaa research meteorologist martin hoerling said. ""we don't know how long it will stay in this pattern.""",1884
science,"about 175 million years ago, the ancestors of today's snakes and lizards probably gave birth to live young, researchers reported last week in ecology letters.the finding counters a long-held belief that the,000 or so species of snakes and lizards that give live birth evolved only recently, said alex pyron, a biologist at george washington university .dr. pyron and frank t. burbrink of the city university of new york used dna sequencing to create an evolutionary tree of more than,000 snake and lizard species. they discovered that today's live-bearing snakes and lizards belong to earlier, more ancient branches of the evolutionary tree.over the millenniums, the researchers also found, many species have vacillated between laying eggs and giving live birth, and climate has been important in driving the switch. in colder times, snakes and lizards seem to favor live birth. even today, the viviparous, or common, lizard lays eggs in southern europe but gives live birth farther north in scandinavia.""eggs don't do so well in colder climates,"" dr. pyron said.",824
arts,"after its early dominance of international film production was shattered by world war i, france never quite managed to sustain a studio system on the hollywood industrial model. what the french achieved instead was an artisanal cinema built around independent producers, several of whom — like adolphe osso in the 1930s, andré paulvé in the '50s and anatole dauman in the '60s and '70s — had tastes pronounced enough to establish identities for their firms . these maisons de production functioned more like book publishers than dream factories, attracting a certain kind of talent for individual productions rather than putting rosters of stars and filmmakers under contract for a steady stream of releases.a new box set of dvds from flicker alley, ""french masterworks: russian émigrés in paris,"" is a five- film retrospective devoted to one of the earliest and most ambitious of these production companies, la société des films albatros. founded in 1922 by alexandre kamenka, the son of a banker from odessa, the company began as home to a group of russian actors and directors who had fled their studios in yalta after lenin nationalized film production in 1919 (albatros was the name of the ship that carried them to france.but after the company's russian talent — including its greatest asset, the magnetic actor ivan mosjoukine (sometimes rendered as mozzhukhin) — was raided by a rival firm, kamenka turned to the emerging filmmakers of the french avant-garde . albatros produced important early work by jean epstein, marcel l'herbier, jacques feyder and rené clair, whose 1928 farce, ""the italian straw hat,"" remains probably the best-known albatros film today (and the subject of a fine flicker alley edition a few years ago .the selection here bridges the transition, and is bookended by major discoveries: ""le brasier ardent"" (""the burning crucible, an unclassifiable 1923 amalgam of satire, suspense and screaming melodrama directed by and starring mosjoukine; and ""les nouveaux messieurs"" (""the new gentlemen, a scathing political satire directed by feyder in 1928 built around a bittersweet love story . the pivotal point is occupied by, appropriately, ""the late mathias pascal, starring mosjoukine and directed by l'herbier, which flicker alley released earlier this year in an impressive stand-alone blu-ray edition.with his hypnotic blue eyes, magnificent beak of a nose and jumpy, restless physicality, mosjoukine was one of the few european performers of the day whose popularity rivaled, in the home market at least, that of major american stars like douglas fairbanks and rudolph valentino.in ""le brasier ardent,"" however, mosjoukine often suggests a slavic buster keaton, with his deadpan performance, fascination with multiple personalities (mosjoukine plays no fewer than 11 roles here, and skill in constructing complex, mechanical sight gags. the movie opens with a burst of wild imagery — the dream of the bored, frustrated wife (nathalie lissenko) about a wealthy older man — in which mosjoukine appears in roles as widely varied as a martyr burning at the stake and a silk-hatted roué visiting the sort of underground cabaret-brothel-opium-den that david lynch would be conjuring 70 years later. (more lynchian than lynch, mosjoukine's nightclub comes equipped with a curtain that burns from the bottom up as it is being raised.the dream comes to an end, when madame wakes up and discovers that her fantasies have been inspired by the pulp magazine adventures of a master detective known only as z (mosjoukine, of course, as a character that might have been drawn from a louis feuillade serial like ""les vampires.but for most of its running time, ""le brasier ardent"" seems to be following a similarly oneiric, free-associative structure, as the husband finds himself hiring z (a partner in an exclusive, clandestine detective agency, where the operatives are psychologists as well as investigators ) in a misguided attempt to recapture his wife's affections. it's all the more impressive, then, when the film finally reveals itself to have been following the sequence of events laid out in the dream sequence all along.",914

science,"perhaps no destination has attracted and inspired more great naturalists than brazil. charles darwin, on his epic voyage on the h.m.s. beagle, first made landfall at bahia in; two fellow englishmen, alfred russel wallace and henry walter bates, arrived at pará in. wallace roamed the amazon for four years, and the indefatigable bates for.in, a naturalist named fritz müller arrived from germany. much less known today, müller, unlike his english contemporaries, moved to brazil with his wife and young child and had no intention of ever returning to prussia. a freethinker who refused to swear an oath to god required for his medical graduation, müller traded a medical career in europe for a mud-floor hut at the edge of virgin forest in the blumenau colony in santa catarina.while darwin and wallace would conceive of the theory of evolution by natural selection, its acceptance was aided greatly by bates and müller. and thanks to bates and müller, perhaps no group of animals contributed more to the early growth of evolutionary science than butterflies. their ideas continue to inspire naturalists today and have led to surprising new insights into how evolution works.both men found brazil ablaze with colorful butterflies. bates noticed among his collections certain species whose bright wing patterns closely resembled those of other butterfly families in the area. in puzzling out why one species would mimic another, he realized that harmless butterflies were mimicking noxious species that were unpalatable to birds and lizards, and therefore not attacked by predators.only a few years after darwin published ""on the origin of species,"" bates suggested that this sort of mimicry — now called ""batesian"" — was timely proof of the principle of natural selection .while bates was a full-time collector, müller was initially occupied with more basic concerns. for his first few years in brazil, he eked out a living as a farmer, raising chickens and pigs and trapping game, while enduring floods and fending off hostile indigenous tribes, jaguars and tropical diseases. as the only person in his settlement with medical training, it fell to him to attend to neighbors who had been impaled with five-foot-long arrows.as his family expanded, eventually to six daughters, müller moved to a coastal town to teach mathematics, natural history, and even some physics and chemistry. his position gave him a chance to explore more intellectual pursuits, and there he discovered darwin's new theories.""origin"" so transformed müller's understanding of nature that he was inspired to write his own book, ""für darwin,"" that presented facts and arguments in favor of his theory, including müller's own observations on brazilian plants and animals . the two men struck up a lively and warm correspondence that would last 17 years, until darwin's death. darwin referred to müller as the ""prince of observers,"" and although they never met, müller considered darwin a second father.müller's crucial observation occurred after he returned to living in the forest. it was a new twist on mimicry. he noticed that unpalatable butterflies were also mimicking other species of unpalatable butterflies in the same area. if they were already unpalatable, he wondered, what added advantage was there to mimicking other species?it dawned on him that unpalatable mimics would enjoy strength in numbers: their unpalatability had to be learned by naïve predators, and mimicking species would share the cost of those lessons, whereas a uniquely patterned unpalatable species would bear the full cost. he showed through simple algebra that two or more unpalatable species would each gain an advantage through a common pattern. natural selection thus explained why different species' wing patterns would converge. but how were such similar but complex wing color patterns generated by different species? that was a much more difficult question, and its answer eluded scientists for nearly 150 years, until an international team of researchers recently revealed mimicry's innermost secrets .the most striking and famous examples of what is still called ""müllerian mimicry"" involve heliconius butterflies in south and central america . in many instances, the wing patterns of different species in the same area are remarkably similar. and even more remarkable, each species may exhibit several different wing patterns, each specific to a given area. the wing patterns are so similar that it is hard to tell species apart from even a short distance — and that is the point.there are two fundamentally different ways müllerian mimicry could evolve: either each species independently evolved mutations that led to very similar wing patterns, or patterning genes were exchanged among species.several genes controlling the production of the wing patterns have now been identified, enabling researchers to distinguish between these alternatives. the answer? both mechanisms have been at work.by analyzing the dna sequences in two mimicking heliconius species distributed across south america, researchers could determine that each species had independently evolved up to 20 different patterns that were nearly identical in each species. but in more closely related mimicking species, they found that color-controlling genes had been exchanged.these discoveries are equally interesting. it is astonishing that so many patterns could be independently generated and replicated in different species. and it is surprising to have species swapping genes in the amazon. after all, the inability to breed successfully with other groups has long been an operational definition of species.but as we peer into genomes, we continue to detect evidence of past interbreeding — between darwin's finches, for example, and even between neanderthals and our own species, homo sapiens. even if such interspecies matings are rare, a gene that confers a strong advantage, like mimicry, can spread quickly through a population.one of my favorite observations about scientific progress was offered by the nobel physicist jean baptiste perrin, who said that the key to any advance was to be able ""to explain the complex visible by some simple invisible."" after being shrouded in mystery for more than a century, the revelation of the invisible genes that have generated such diversity is an exquisite example of the maxim.",1735
sports,"ardmore, pa. — history says tiger woods has little chance to win this u.s. open. not from behind, and certainly not with an elbow inflammation that seems to bother him most on his worst shots. woods says otherwise, and after a marathon stretch of play friday that helped him creep into contention at merion golf club it's still possible he could be the one having the last say.trying to break a winless streak in major championships that now spans five full years, woods played 25-plus holes in a respectable 1-over 70 to move up the leaderboard on a day when many other players were going the other way.it wasn't good enough to get under par, or even crack the top. but he was just four shots back and in prime position to make a move over the weekend on an open course that is playing much tougher than a lot of people expected.asked if he liked his chances, woods didn't hesitate to answer, ""yes."" woods had some issues on a day that began for him in the early morning and didn't finish until midafternoon. he missed some putts he might ordinarily expect to make, barely moved a chip a few inches forward, and guessed wrong on a couple of shots.but that's u.s. open golf, and the best player in the world stood at 3-over 143 after two rounds — the same as playing partner and budding buddy rory mcilroy .""i just made a couple of mistakes out there today, but i really played well,"" woods said. ""maybe i could have gotten one or two more out of it, but it was a pretty good day.""the night before, woods underwent some treatment on his left elbow, which he shook several times after hitting bad shots in the first 11 holes of a rain-delayed round. he said he hurt the elbow at the players championship and that it was painful at times, though on his good shots it didn't seem to bother him at all.""it is what it is,"" woods said. mcilroy said he didn't even notice woods was having difficulty with the elbow.""i haven't seen anything wrong with him,"" mcilroy said after finishing with his own.more worrisome than the elbow for woods might be the fact he's never won a tournament after playing over par for the first two rounds. he's also never won a major championship coming from behind in the final round .and then there's that winless streak in major championships that now stretches back to the 2008 u.s. open at torrey pines.but while woods remains stuck at 14 in his chase of the record of 18 majors won by jack nicklaus, it doesn't mean he's forgotten how to win in conditions favored at the open.""just keep grinding,"" he said. ""you don't ever know what the winning score is going to be. you don't know if the guys are going to come back. we have a long way to go, and these conditions aren't going to get any easier.""the conditions friday were challenging enough, though woods and mcilroy got the better of the weather . for the most part, they avoided winds that started to pick up in the afternoon as the rain -saturated course began drying out.the two are the main golf stars for nike and have become increasingly friendly over the past few years, though they are 13 years apart in age. woods has 12 more major titles than mcilroy, but the star from northern ireland has won his two during woods' winless drought. mcilroy said he and woods chatted during the round, though both tried to keep focused on the task at hand. after missing a final birdie putt on their last hole, the 10th, mcilroy told woods that he was trying to make the putt so he didn't have to play with woods on saturday.""so he's got the pleasure of playing with me,"" mcilroy said. ""but, no, we had a good laugh out there and just because it's the u.s. open doesn't mean anything."" mcilroy, the 2011 open champion at congressional who has struggled this year after switching to nike equipment, had his moments, including an iron shot to the eighth hole that gave him a tap-in birdie and put him under par for the day. but he gave it back on the next hole and had to hit a great shot out of the deep rough on his final hole to finish off his even par second round.the kind of challenge merion has been so far was reflected in the score of both players. they made six birdies apiece during the first two rounds, but both also made nine bogeys — an average of one in every four holes.""it tests every aspect of your game,"" mcilroy said, referring to merion. ""you've got to drive it well. where these pins are, you got to hit great iron shots. you got to be very tactical. you got to be mentally really well there and have a good game plan.""like woods, mcilroy was comfortable with where he was midway through the championship .""there were people talking about 62s and 63s at the start of the week and, i mean, i never saw that at all,"" he said. ""i still think that something very little under par is going to win this week. if or if not that, around even par.""",1485

""she knew they weren't there for lunch.""the murders have shaken union county, the site of the well-known 1994 killings of two children by their mother, susan smith. it is otherwise a place largely without serious crime .""you hate hearing anything like that,"" said grady carson, an employee at a hardware store where the parkers shopped. ""we've all done something in our past, and nobody wants someone to show up with a gun and play god.""jack levin, a criminologist who is co-director of the brudnick center on violence and conflict at northeastern university, said it was likely that mr. moody possessed a common trait among killers.""serial killers often attempt to justify their killing sprees, and they usually do it by dehumanizing their victims,"" dr. levin said.but the case in south carolina is otherwise odd, he said.""it's very unusual that someone would set out to kill large numbers of sex offenders .""mr. moody is not the first person accused of targeting sex offenders . as recently as last month, a california jury convicted a 36-year-old man of killing a neighbor who was a sex offender, and a washington state man was sentenced in 2012 to life in prison for a pair of similar killings.",1017
