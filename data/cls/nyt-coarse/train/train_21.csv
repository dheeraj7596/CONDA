science,"""kafkaesque"" is not a word normally used to describe immune responses, but it's how dr. louis j. picker described what his experimental vaccine did to his rhesus monkeys: ""it's like their t-cells were turned into the east german secret police, hunting down infected cells until there were none left.""recent work by dr. picker, a vaccine expert at oregon health & science university, has shaken up the long, frustrating search for an aids vaccine. his latest study, published in nature last week, has scientists scratching their heads, wondering if it might open up a new avenue for research.dr. picker tested his vaccine in 16 monkeys who were then infected with simian immunodeficiency virus, a close relative of h.i.v., which normally would have sent them spiraling rapidly down to a miserable death. the experimental vaccine protected only nine of them, but it also did something never seen before: these monkeys slowly ""cleared"" the virus and now appear to be cured. ""three years later, you can't tell them from other monkeys,"" dr. picker said.dr. anthony s. fauci, the head of the national institute for allergy and infectious diseases, said the effect was ""unique.""and dr. barton f. haynes, the director of the human vaccine institute at duke university's medical school, said it was ""potentially extremely important to understand how this happened.""scientists often test ideas for potential aids vaccines by creating similar ones against s.i.v. never before has one eliminated an existing infection. in that sense, the effect of dr. picker's vaccine was less like that of a measles or flu shot and more like that of the aids cures used in two famous cases, known as the berlin patient and the mississippi baby.the berlin patient, timothy ray brown, was infected with h.i.v. and cured only by obliterating his immune system to defeat his leukemia, and then injecting bone marrow from a donor with a rare h.i.v.-blocking mutation. the unidentified baby was born to an infected mother in mississippi and apparently infected with h.i.v., but then cured with early and large doses of antiretroviral drugs.both now appear to have no h.i.v. lurking deep in their bodies, but it is impossible to be sure because not every bit of their tissue can be tested.because he works with monkeys, dr. picker was able to do something that would be unthinkable with human patients — necropsy them, grind up every organ and take 240 samples from each to be sure that they harbored no hidden virus.making vaccines by simply weakening the virus that causes aids has failed because the virus mutates a hundred times faster than even the fast-mutating flu virus. in dr. picker's vaccine, s.i.v. genes are fused to those of another virus, the cytomegalovirus. (the name means ""big cell,"" and it is in the herpes family but different from its relatives that cause lip and genital sores, chickenpox and shingles.)h.i.v. fusion has been tried with adenoviruses and others, but cytomegalovirus seems to work better. it's not entirely clear why, but one theory is that cytomegalovirus has a very long history of infecting primates — so much so that 100 percent of monkeys and about 80 percent of humans get it in their lifetimes.therefore, we primates have adapted to it. although the virus can be lethal to fetuses and to those with immune systems suppressed by aids or transplant drugs, in most victims it causes no symptoms.the body responds to cytomegalovirus more slowly and calmly than it does, for example, to a flu.as in any infection, the thymus gland generates new white blood cells called t cells — in this case, cd8 hunter-killer cells — primed to target the specific virus. but in the case of dr. picker's vaccine, those cells stay in an unusual ""half-alert"" state . a full-blown immune response eventually exhausts itself, and can even be dangerous. for example, the rare humans who catch h5n1 bird flu often die of the immune response itself; they drown in the flood of cd8s and other would-be saviors pouring into the lung tissue, spoiling for a fight.that ""half-alert"" state is the ""kafkaesque"" element: unactivated cd8s wander around aimlessly, while fully activated ones behave like storm troopers. but the half-activated cd8s persist in tissues, eliminating their targets quietly without triggering inflammation or even a mild fever.when s.i.v. genes are fused to the cytomegalovirus spine, the cd8s kill s.i.v.-infected cells too.since it protected only some monkeys, the new technique might be best used in combination approaches. for example, dr. fauci said, it could be given with a vaccine that generates antibodies against h.i.v. ""and maybe eliminate the cells that sneak past the antibody shield.""alternatively, the vaccine might be given to infected patients who are on antiretroviral drugs to see if it can ""mop up"" lingering reservoirs of virus.it should take up to three years to get a human version ready for trials, dr. picker estimated .""now the outstanding question is, 'why only half?' "" said dr. mike mccune, an aids researcher at the university of california, san francisco, referring to the monkeys who were protected in dr. picker's trial.too often, aids advances that work in lots of monkeys don't work in many humans.""not all monkeys are the same,"" dr. mccune said. ""they're not as inbred as mice, but they're sometimes from the same families, they get the same diets... who knows what will happen if this goes into humans?""",213
politics,"washington — as a possible government shutdown looms, environmental activists who oppose construction of the keystone xl pipeline say they are increasingly alarmed that the project might become a bargaining chip in last-minute negotiations between republicans and president obama to avert a fiscal crisis .if built, the,700-mile pipeline would carry millions of gallons of crude oil from alberta in canada to american refineries on the gulf coast . because it crosses an international border, the pipeline requires approval by mr. obama's administration after a review by the state department . mr. obama has repeatedly said he would not make a decision until that process was complete.but republicans who support the pipeline have already signaled that they intend to demand approval of a permit for its construction in exchange for their willingness to support mr. obama and raise the nation's debt ceiling next month.""we feel like this is our only option,"" said representative lee terry, a nebraska republican who is one of the leading pipeline supporters . mr. terry said members of his party were working to draft legislative language that would ""deem"" the pipeline to be approved if an agreement is reached to raise the debt ceiling .the pipeline could become an issue even earlier as lawmakers wrangle to avoid a shutdown by next tuesday.""even though this threat is patently absurd, we are of course taking it seriously,"" said tiernan sittenfeld, a senior vice president at the league of conservation voters, which opposes the pipeline . she said republicans ""feel like now is their opportunity on a must-pass bill. it's a really cynical, disturbing view of how government should function."" environmentalists say they are cautiously optimistic that mr. obama will not yield to pressure from the pipeline's supporters in congress, including some in the president's own party . but mr. obama has left his views on the pipeline murky, refusing to say whether he plans to approve it or not. and with the stakes of a shutdown or a debt default so high, opponents of the pipeline remain on edge.""our entire campaign has been premised that the president will make good on his promises and rhetoric on climate change,"" said dan kessler, a spokesman for.org, a group waging a campaign against construction of the pipeline . ""we don't expect him to cede any of that control to crazy republicans .""but mr. kessler added, ""this is going to be another test of his leadership and commitment.""mr. obama has said flatly that he will not negotiate with republicans about what he sees as the imperative to raise the debt ceiling and avoid a potentially catastrophic default on america's obligations. but white house officials say they are willing to have discussions about the budget to avoid a government shutdown — although they say the pipeline should not be part of those talks .mr. obama has repeatedly resisted efforts by republicans to force him to speed up the approval process for the pipeline . during the 2012 election campaign, mr. obama faced blasts of criticism from pipeline supporters, including mitt romney, his republican opponent, who said he should make a decision quickly and insisted that the pipeline project would help create american jobs .earlier this year, environmentalists expected that mr. obama would approve the pipeline . but in a speech at georgetown university in june, mr. obama made it clear that he would approve the pipeline only if the reviews concluded that it did not ""significantly exacerbate"" the amount of carbon in the environment. ""the net effects of the pipeline's impact on our climate will be absolutely critical to determining whether this project is allowed to go forward,"" he said then. ""it's relevant.""on tuesday, white house officials said republicans were playing politics with the environment. ""the president has demonstrated his fidelity to the state department finishing its review, as part of the transparent and rigorous process that will determine whether the pipeline is in the best interests of the united states,"" said josh earnest, a white house spokesman. ""that's how this merit-based determination will be made.""",1984

business,"hong kong — deflation remains firmly entrenched in japan, figures showed on friday, despite optimistic forecasts from the country's central bank, highlighting that there are no quick fixes for one of the world's largest economies . prime minister shinzo abe, who took office last december, has made the fight against deflation — the damaging decline in prices, profits and wages that has dogged japan for most of the last 15 years — a central tenet of his economic policy . at his urging, the central bank committed to a target of 2 percent annual inflation, considered by many economists a healthy level.on friday, the central bank, the bank of japan, under the leadership of its new governor, haruhiko kuroda, put a date on that target: 2015 or early.""various indicators are showing signs that inflation expectations are heightening as a trend,"" mr. kuroda said in a news conference on friday, reuters reported . "" business and household sentiment is improving."""" japan's economy has stopped weakening and has shown some signs of picking up,"" the bank of japan said in its economic report. ""looking ahead, it is expected to return to a moderate recovery path around mid."" the bank cited a likely improvement in domestic demand as the increased money supply and other economic measures announced took effect.the central bank also raised its growth forecasts for this year and the next. the bank said the economy would gradually accelerate to.6 percent growth in the fiscal year that ends in march.the optimistic projections were made as worse-than-expected economic data for march was released by the statistics bureau. core consumer prices, which exclude food, fell.5 percent compared with march, the fifth consecutive month of year-on-year declines.the news added to the doubts of some economists that japan's grinding deflationary era would end soon. the figure ""offered another reminder that deflationary pressures remain strong,"" izumi devalier, japan economist at hsbc, wrote in a research note . although a gradual escape from deflation is expected, thanks in part to higher energy prices, she said the inflation rate was unlikely to match what she called the bank of japan's ""optimistic projections .""the hurdle for reaching the inflation target is ""getting higher,"" miwako nakamura, an economist at j. p. morgan, wrote in a research note .shortly after mr. kuroda took the top job at the central bank this month, it announced unexpectedly bold steps aimed at reinvigorating economic and price growth . the bank committed to inflating the economy by aggressively doubling its holdings of government bonds in two years. mr. kuroda described the program as "" monetary easing in an entirely new dimension."" it was widely heralded as a marked change from incremental steps pursued by his predecessors.the financial markets have welcomed mr. abe's and mr. kuroda's joint efforts. the nikkei 225-stock index has risen 30 percent since the start of the year, while the yen has fallen 14 percent against the dollar — much to the relief of japanese exporters, for whom a weaker yen is welcome as it makes their goods relatively cheaper abroad.several japanese corporate giants, including honda, toyota and canon, have cited the weaker yen as a reason for improved earnings and outlooks in recent days .honda said its net profit for the financial year that ended in march was up.6 percent at.15 billion yen, or.75 billion, according to reuters. mazda recorded a yearly net profit of.3 billion yen, after a.7 billion yen loss in the previous year. growth strategies aimed at stimulating private investment are the most important of the policy arrows in mr. abe's quiver, kunihiko sugio, chief investment officer at invesco japan, said in a recent research note.this ""arrow,"" he added, ""is still in abe's hand waiting to be fired.""",1522

""we need to change that, and you will hear the president talk a lot about it in the weeks and months ahead.""in november, the white house announced a new $100 million grant program aimed at advancing technical training in high schools . but veteran apprenticeship advocates say the obama administration has been slow to act.""the results have not matched the rhetoric in terms of direct funding for apprenticeships so far,"" said robert lerman, a professor of economics at american university in washington . ""i'm hoping for a new push.""in germany, apprentices divide their time between classroom training in a public vocational school and practical training at a company or small firm . some 330 types of apprenticeships are accredited by the government in berlin, including such jobs as hairdresser, roofer and automobile electronics specialist. about 60 percent of german high school students go through some kind of apprenticeship program, which leads to a formal certificate in the chosen skill and often a permanent job at the company where the young person trained.if there is a downside to the german system, it is that it can be inflexible, because a person trained in a specific skill may find it difficult to switch vocations if demand shifts.in south carolina, apprenticeships are mainly funded by employers, but the state introduced a four-year, annual tax credit of,000 per position in 2007 that proved to be a boon for small- to medium-size companies . the center for american progress report recommends a similar credit nationwide that would rise to,000 for apprentices under age.the emphasis on job training has also been a major calling card overseas for south carolina officials, who lured bmw here two decades ago and more recently persuaded france's michelin and germany's continental tire to expand in the state .""the european influence is huge,"" said brad neese, director of apprenticeship carolina, which links the state's technical college system with private companies to help create specialized programs.

politics,"boston — for more than 40 years, power and influence fit william m. bulger like a tailored suit, and his résumé expanded with accomplishment: up from the projects to become a lawyer, the longest-serving president of the state senate, the president of the university of massachusetts, a consummate democratic power broker and a cultural lion in boston .but he forfeited this legacy long ago, shedding it in exchange for intense loyalty to another boston power broker, his older brother, james (whitey) bulger, the city's notorious crime boss.the currency was silence — william bulger's steadfast refusal to cooperate with the authorities or to distance himself publicly from whitey, who this month was convicted of participating in 11 murders and sundry other crimes and was sent to prison for life.it was this silence that cost william bulger his university position 10 years ago and deepened suspicions that he knew more about his brother's exploits than he let on. after all, william lived right next door to a house owned by one of whitey's partners in crime, where the gang hatched plots, stored an arsenal of weapons and even committed murder.when whitey was captured in 2011 after 16 years on the run, william attended the arraignment, but he has otherwise lain low. he did not show up at the eight-week trial over the summer, nor did he appear for the verdict or sentencing.recently, he gave a rare interview, by phone, to a wcvb-tv reporter, but his guarded answers suggested no break in the fraternal bond.he said he was ""shocked by some of the things"" that came out in court, but did not specify which things. he said he saw his brother once a week in jail, but added that ""just because i visit him doesn't mean i condone it.""mr. bulger did not say what ""it"" was, nor did he condemn it.he also said he still did not know what was true or false, fact or fiction, but said that his brother had made ""fervent denials"" regarding the charges against him.""i don't try to sort it out any longer,"" he said. ""i just try to be a brother.""that he was ""a brother"" may be a fitting epitaph for mr. bulger, 79, as he and whitey, 84, resign themselves to the likelihood that whitey will someday die in prison (though he is appealing his conviction.mr. bulger lives out of the public eye now, the stain of his brother's convictions and the ambiguity of his own role suggesting that this onetime prince of south boston may be remembered less for what he said than for what he never said.his silence led to unfavorable comparisons between him and the brother of the unabomber, whose case was unfolding just as the authorities here were pressing mr. bulger to divulge his brother's whereabouts. david kaczynski told the authorities in 1996 that his brother, ted, could be the unabomber, who over the course of almost 20 years had sent bombs through the mail that killed three people and wounded 23 others.by contrast, it is hard to imagine what, if anything, would ever make mr. bulger turn on his brother.

""bill bulger, in the face of a god-awful amount of horror, has made a different choice.""that choice, mr. lehr said, raised some eternal questions: ""at what point does a relative's conduct cross the line ? when does the greater good count more than blood loyalty?""robert h. quinn, a former speaker of the state house and a longtime friend of william bulger, said that for william, whom he still sees regularly, ""love and affection for family"" remain paramount.he said william bulger reminded him of the oft-told story of a boy at father flanagan's home for boys who carried on his back another who had polio and wore heavy leg braces. when father flanagan asked the boy if carrying him was hard, the boy replied, ""he ain't heavy, father, he's m' brother.""it was the bulger brothers' contrasting life stories that gripped the public imagination. william, who studied greek and latin and went to law school, operated within the system, while his murderous older brother conducted a reign of terror on the outside. but growing up in a big irish catholic family in a tight-knit enclave of south boston, where lack of loyalty could cost a life, they had much in common. at the peak of their powers, they controlled their respective constituencies the same way — with fear and intimidation. as one longtime politician once told boston magazine: ""what whitey does with a gun, billy does with a gavel.""a sharp dresser who could carry a tune, william bulger exuded cockiness as he hosted southie's main political event, the st . patrick's day breakfast, and pranced down the streets, george m. cohan style, at the head of the parade — all on display in a flattering ""60 minutes"" segment on him in.but after whitey descended into what the judge in his case called unfathomable depravity and he went into hiding, william bulger's stature began to erode. he refused to meet with the f.b.i. and told a grand jury that he hoped he would never do anything that would lead to his brother's capture.in, he took the fifth amendment before a congressional committee investigating his brother's corrupt relationship with the f.b.i. after being given immunity, he testified before congress in 2003 that he did not know his brother was involved in murder or narcotics trafficking and even denied having heard of the notorious winter hill gang, which his brother led.when a congressman asked if he wanted whitey to give himself up, ""the normally loquacious bulger sat for several moments, unable to speak,"" as kevin cullen and shelley murphy described the scene in their book, ""whitey bulger."" ""he opened and closed his mouth several times, but nothing came out.""his apparent stonewalling led to his forced resignation from the university, though he left with a state pension of,000 a year.""faced with a moral dilemma,"" scot lehigh, a boston globe columnist, wrote in 2011 after whitey was captured, ""william repeatedly made the wrong choice, putting loyalty to his felonious brother over responsibility to his neighborhood, his constituents, or the larger public community whose university he led.""""i admire him for not being coerced into jackpotting his brother,"" said harvey a. silverglate, a prominent criminal defense and civil rights lawyer here.but, mr. silverglate said, ""when you elevate loyalty, you have to pay a price for it and you have to be prepared to suffer."" mr. bulger has suffered, he said, though not nearly as much as the families of whitey's murder victims .those relatives were given a chance at whitey's sentencing to tell the gangster how he had ruined their lives, regardless of whether he was found guilty of their loved one's death. a few noted that whitey had ruined the lives of his own family members, too.""it should be written that you had a brother who was a lawmaker who ended up lacking integrity and honesty,"" said tom angeli, the son of a murder victim. ""that's how i want history to remember this case .""",477
arts,"one afternoon this fall tyler, the creator, and his buddies earl sweatshirt and jasper dolphin, of the rap collective odd future, turned up on a street corner in downtown los angeles . their agenda: to shoot a cameo for the music video ""happy,"" by pharrell williams .no elaborate instructions were involved. ""he hit me up and asked if i wanted to be in it, and i'm a big fan, and i said, 'yeah,' "" tyler recounted of the texted invitation. he happened to be hanging out with earl and jasper when the shoot happened, so they went along. they didn't discuss what they would do or how they would move. no choreographer or costumer weighed in, and there was no set.""we got out, they played the song, we walked down the block, five minutes later we're driving back to our cars, and we left,"" tyler said. ""it was sick.""on screen, the three men, in grins and t-shirts (tyler's features a stoned-looking cat, execute jazzy, improbably synchronized dance moves that tyler said they improvised on the spot. it's a goofy and joyful off-the-cuff moment that belies the months of work and painstaking production that went into the song and the video, the latest of mr. williams's many genre-defying projects. unexpectedly, mr. williams struggled with it in the studio, even as he also had a hand in two of this year's biggest songs, daft punk's ""get lucky"" and robin thicke's "" blurred lines .""those tracks have some night life slink to them. ""happy,"" written for the soundtrack of the animated film ""despicable me,"" is g rated: a four-minute composition layered over a gospel chord progression and an up-tempo organ thrum that invites listeners to clap along, ""if you feel like happiness is a truth."" its infectiousness was multiplied exponentially in november, when mr. williams revealed what he billed as the world's first 24-hour music video, known online as ""24 hours of happy.""an ingenious interactive work, it moves through the day in real time, following a cast of hundreds of quirky people, a few celebrities and mr. williams, as they dance through los angeles . it quickly became a viral hit, with nearly.5 million views on its dedicated site, and a reputation as a surefire mood booster . giddily addictive, it has already spawned imitators from paris to grand rapids, mich.""i've never been connected to anything that big in my life,"" mr. williams, 40, said of the waves of emotion the video has inspired. two decades into a career as a hit maker for the likes of jay z, britney spears, snoop dogg, no doubt and many more, he was being modest. this month he was nominated for seven grammys, including producer of the year, for "" blurred lines,"" ""get lucky,"" ""happy"" and others. ""happy"" is also on the shortlist to be nominated for an academy award in january, for best song.but it nearly didn't happen. ""this was a hard song for him to nail,"" christopher meledandri, a producer of ""despicable me,"" said.trying to highlight a pivotal moment of character development in the movie, mr. williams wrote and rejected nine anthems. ""i was just coming from a really pure place of, you know, not having any more ideas for it,"" he said. ""i was backed in the corner. i had nothing left.""the film's directors, pierre coffin and chris renaud, pushed him, and he tried to stop thinking through the problem. ""because if i use my mind, then i had all these references, and that's what the other nine songs were,"" he said. "" 'happy' would have had something about a little booty in there somewhere"" — some vestige of a club track like snoop's ""drop it like it's hot."" instead, ""i was like, what does being happy feel like?"" mr. williams said at a recent event celebrating the film and the song at the plaza hotel in new york.at the party, he wore a lumpy margiela sweater and a t-shirt of his own design — fashion and art, two more worlds to conquer — and chatted casually with a couple unfamiliar with his multi-hyphenate artistic background, about growing up in virginia .""all of this is new to me,"" he said, of his high-profile year. ""i'm used to standing beside someone in a video, not standing in front."" in ""24 hours of happy,"" he appears at the top of every hour, nattily dressed and effortlessly shimmying around alleyways and bowling lanes. he shot the four-minute segments over two consecutive days in september, in 24 locations, but the entire filming lasted 11 days.""it was brutal,"" said mimi valdés, the creative director of mr. williams's production company . but, she added, the crew members knew that if they could pull it off, ""this could be big.""the video, conceived by the french directing duo known as we are from l.a., starts to play at a time that corresponds to the clock on viewers' computers. from there, viewers can watch it chronologically or scroll around a clock face to see, say, a b-boy and modern dancer bouncing off the pumps at a gas station at half-past midnight, or magic johnson grooving in his home trophy room at:38 a.m. the video was shot in real time, too — there's kelly osbourne, strolling hollywood boulevard at 1 a.m. — with the cast of over 360 getting only a single take each.""it was one of the most surreal five minutes of my life,"" said ms. osbourne, the tv host and fashion commentator. she had met mr. williams around los angeles, and he invited her to participate after they happened to vacation in the same spot. but she also didn't get much background on the project. ""i had seven-inch saint laurent heels on, not expecting to be dancing down hollywood boulevard,"" she said. the sound came from a speaker on a wheelchair — ""it looked like a homeless person had stolen it from a hospital"" — and it was shot guerrilla style, with no streets blocked off. spectators sometimes wander through a scene, or gawk. (impromptu, tyler, the creator, grabbed a broom to dance with from a store's display, and the shopkeeper followed him to retrieve it.)the voice actors from ""despicable me,"" like steve carell and miranda cosgrove, also appear, along with some costumed characters from the movie (mr. williams's idea. ms. cosgrove merely walks, slightly bobbing, down the street in her section. ""i'm a really bad dancer,"" she explained. ""that was, like, a lot for me. i feel like i was going all out."" but the freedom to do as she pleased was appealing.""with other music videos, they've been really structured, and you have to worry about the story line, and this was really about having a good time,"" said ms. cosgrove, an actress and singer. ""all the people that were in the crew were dancing on the other side of the camera. it was really fun. i felt like it was like a flash mob or something.""the video's directors, clément durou and pierre dupaquier, didn't expect audiences to watch the whole thing consecutively. ""even us, we didn't watch the 24 hours in a row,"" mr. durou said in a phone interview from paris. (a few bloggers have done it, though, and mr. durou said his mother was making an attempt.) they did hope to disrupt the normally passive act of watching music videos .""the main point is to create freedom for the viewers and to make actors, and not spectators, in front of the videos,"" mr. durou said. and they wanted to showcase a canon of movement on screen, ""like a dictionary of dance,"" mr. durou said.so the marriage of mr. williams's toe-tapping song and their interactive 24-hour concept — which they had had for a while — was creatively fortuitous, they said. the diverse locations and casting, which mr. williams insisted on, also fit, mr. durou said, to show that whoever, ""whenever and wherever you are, you can be happy.""",1353
arts,"new york a hotbed of early music? no one would have said so 20 years ago (when some of us were saying the opposite ) or even 10 years ago . but a remarkable shift has occurred over the last decade or so, thanks to a web of interlocking factors, including the formation of a curriculum in historical performance at the juilliard school, the exponential growth of the music program at trinity wall street, the enterprise of groups like tenet and the sebastians and the work of the service organization gotham early music scene.even in the barren years past, there were always imported productions, so something like the superb concert performance of handel's opera 'radamisto' at carnegie hall in february — with the english concert and star singers like david daniels and luca pisaroni, conducted by harry bicket — came as no surprise. but a second ""radamisto"" in the same year, and this one homegrown and fully staged? that was a surprise.in november, juilliard opera combined forces with juilliard, the orchestra of the historical performance program, in a spare but effective staging of ""radamisto"" in the school's peter jay sharp theater, directed by james darrah and conducted by julian wachner, the moving force behind that surge in trinity wall street's music program. two singers — mary feminear, soprano, and virginie verrez, mezzo-soprano — stood out in a generally fine cast of young performers.it has been a big year for handel not only in new york, where things are still wrapping up with the usual crop of ""messiah"" performances, but also in boston, which has long been used as a club to beat new york with when it comes to nurturing a thriving early-music scene. the centerpiece of the biennial boston early music festival in june was handel's first opera 'almira' in a lavish and wonderful production by gilbert blin at the cutler majestic theater.notable handel performances in new york included another exalted import, the dramatic cantata 'aci, galatea e polifemo,' presented in october at alice tully hall as part of lincoln center's white light festival. emmanuelle haïm conducted her splendid period-instrument ensemble, le concert d'astrée, and excellent singers: lydia teuscher, soprano; delphine galou, mezzo-soprano ; and best of all, laurent naouri, baritone, as the monstrous one-eyed giant polyphemus.oh, and it was also a big year for monteverdi in new york, but i'm out of space. there will be more next year, when tenet and its offshoot green mountain project (named for monteverdi) initiate a new early music festival in new york in june.",1241
science,"for all the adorable images of cats that play the piano, flush the toilet, mew melodiously and find their way back home over hundreds of miles, scientists have identified a shocking new truth: cats are far deadlier than anyone realized.in a report that scaled up local surveys and pilot studies to national dimensions, scientists from the smithsonian conservation biology institute and the fish and wildlife service estimated that domestic cats in the united states — both the pet fluffies that spend part of the day outdoors and the unnamed strays and ferals that never leave it — kill a median of.4 billion birds and.3 billion mammals a year, most of them native mammals like shrews, chipmunks and voles rather than introduced pests like the norway rat.the estimated kill rates are two to four times higher than mortality figures previously bandied about, and position the domestic cat as one of the single greatest human-linked threats to wildlife in the nation. more birds and mammals die at the mouths of cats, the report said, than from automobile strikes, pesticides and poisons, collisions with skyscrapers and windmills and other so-called anthropogenic causes.peter marra of the smithsonian conservation biology institute and an author of the report, said the mortality figures that emerge from the new model ""are shockingly high.""""when we ran the model, we didn't know what to expect,"" said dr. marra, who performed the analysis with a colleague, scott r. loss, and tom will of the fish and wildlife service . ""we were absolutely stunned by the results."" the study appeared tuesday in the journal nature communications.the findings are the first serious estimate of just how much wildlife america's vast population of free-roaming domestic cats manages to kill each year.""we've been discussing this problem of cats and wildlife for years and years, and now we finally have some good science to start nailing down the numbers,"" said george h. fenwick, the president and chief executive of the american bird conservancy. ""this is a great leap forward over the quality of research we had before.""in devising their mathematical model, the researchers systematically sifted through the existing scientific literature on cat-wildlife interactions, eliminated studies in which the sample size was too small or the results too extreme, and then extracted and standardized the findings from the 21 most rigorous studies. the results admittedly come with wide ranges and uncertainties.nevertheless, the new report is likely to fuel the sometimes vitriolic debate between environmentalists who see free-roaming domestic cats as an invasive species — superpredators whose numbers are growing globally even as the songbirds and many other animals the cats prey on are in decline — and animal welfare advocates who are appalled by the millions of unwanted cats (and dogs) euthanized in animal shelters each year.all concur that pet cats should not be allowed to prowl around the neighborhood at will, any more than should a pet dog, horse or potbellied pig, and that cat owners who insist their felines ""deserve"" a bit of freedom are being irresponsible and ultimately not very cat friendly. through recent projects like kitty cams at the university of georgia, in which cameras are attached to the collars of indoor-outdoor pet cats to track their activities, not only have cats been filmed preying on cardinals, frogs and field mice, they have also been shown lapping up antifreeze and sewer sludge, dodging under moving cars and sparring violently with much bigger dogs.""we've put a lot of effort into trying to educate people that they should not let their cats outside, that it's bad for the cats and can shorten the cats' lives,"" said danielle bays, the manager of the community cat programs at the washington humane society.yet the new study estimates that free-roaming pets account for only about 29 percent of the birds and 11 percent of the mammals killed by domestic cats each year, and the real problem arises over how to manage the 80 million or so stray or feral cats that commit the bulk of the wildlife slaughter.the washington humane society and many other animal welfare organizations support the use of increasingly popular trap-neuter-return programs, in which unowned cats are caught, vaccinated, spayed and, if no home can be found for them, returned to the outdoor colony from which they came. proponents see this approach as a humane alternative to large-scale euthanasia, and they insist that a colony of neutered cats can't reproduce and thus will eventually disappear. conservationists say that, far from diminishing the population of unowned cats, trap and release programs may be making it worse, by encouraging people to abandon their pets to outdoor colonies that volunteers often keep lovingly fed.""the number of free roaming cats is definitively growing,"" dr. fenwick of the bird conservancy said. ""it's estimated that there are now more than 500 t.n.r. colonies in austin alone.""they are colonies of subsidized predators, he said, able to survive in far greater concentrations than do wild carnivores by dint of their people-pleasing appeal. ""they're not like coyotes, having to make their way in the world,"" he said.yet even fed cats are profoundly tuned to the hunt, and when they see something flutter, they can't help but move in for the kill. dr. fenwick argues that far more effort should be put into animal adoption. ""for the great majority of healthy cats,"" he said, ""homes can be found."" any outdoor colonies that remain should be enclosed, he said. ""cats don't need to wander hundred of miles to be happy,"" he said.",749

business,"as hybrid securities, preferred stocks fill a useful niche between stocks and bonds, paying high dividends. yet they are often ignored when building an income portfolio.as interest rates have climbed in recent months, though, you have to be careful about buying preferred shares . while they are worthwhile additions to retirement portfolios, you have to be aware of their risk profile.the main benefit of preferred shares is that they generally offer superior yields to bonds and common-stock dividends. at 6 percent or more, preferred yields trumpet an advantage of four percentage points over 10-year treasury notes and even more than insured deposits or short-term bonds .preferred stocks cost less than bonds to own on a per-share basis, are less volatile than common stocks and are more liquid than many bonds, as they trade on the new york stock exchange and over-the-counter markets .what makes preferred stocks odd ducks is that they can be ""called"" — redeemed by the issuer in times of falling rates (just like bonds ) — can be converted into common shares and can shift from fixed to adjustable dividends. if this sounds a little off-putting to you, you are not alone. preferred stocks can get complicated.since preferred shares are sensitive to interest-rate movements — their prices fall when rates climb — you need to be vigilant about their volatility. they can mimic the downside of bond price movements.when federal reserve officials mentioned this year that the central bank might be backing off its bond-buying program, share prices of both bonds and preferred shares sank.since the fed ""taper"" talk first roiled income markets, the s&p preferred stock index, which tracks a basket of the stocks, has reacted negatively. it was down.3 percent year-to-date through aug. 26, compared with an almost 18 percent gain for the s.& p. 500- stock index .because of their proximity to the bond market, preferred shares proved somewhat less volatile than bonds, which fell more than 5 percent for the same period, as tracked by the s&p/bgcantor 7-10 year u.s. treasury bond index .""preferreds act much like bonds,"" said abby woodham, an analyst for morningstar, the investment research firm based in chicago . ""they are quite sensitive to interest-rate changes.""why own preferred shares if they can be churlish in a rising-rate environment? because they offer such high yields, the income component of the stocks still keeps you in the black if share prices lose money during small interest-rate spikes.while buying individual stocks is certainly the riskiest way to invest in preferred stocks — you will need specialized expertise to analyze them — you can buy them in nine exchange-traded funds and several actively managed and closed-end mutual funds .ms. woodham said the major exchange -traded index funds, which hold baskets of preferred stocks at a low cost, included the ishares s&p u.s. preferred stock index etf, which yields just under 6 percent, and the powershares preferred etf, which yields about.6 percent. both funds charge annual expenses of.5 percent or less.although these funds are worthy additions to any income portfolio, their main drawbacks are their heavy concentration in financial sector stocks . for more diversification, consider the cohen & steers preferred securities and income i fund, offering a 6 percent yield. in addition to financial stocks, the fund also holds shares in insurance and real estate companies . it comes at a steeper price: 0.75 percent in annual expenses .michael dubis, a financial planner based in madison, wis., said he recommended the cohen & steers fund for his clients because ""i believe you're better off going active"" — that is, choosing an actively managed fund — in addition to the ishares fund for those who want preferred shares .""for clients seeking preferred stocks in their portfolio, i use the cohen & steers fund for half my preferred positions, which is really no more than 3 percent to 10 percent in a portfolio,"" mr. dubis said.if you are an active investor trading income securities, you will need to keep a close eye on the federal reserve . if the economy continues to heat up, the fed may suspend its $85 billion a month bond-buying program, which could lift interest rates and hurt bond and preferred prices.when asked if the fed might back off its easing program before the end of the year, charles evans, president of the federal reserve bank of chicago, said on aug. 6, ""i clearly would not rule that out.""but most buy-and-hold investors probably need not be so attuned to the fed's vacillations. if preferred stocks occupy a small portion of a diversified portfolio containing united states treasuries, money market funds, corporate bonds, municipal bonds and real estate investment trusts, this kind of diversification offers much less volatility than piling into a single class of high-yield securities .",835
sports,"rex ryan conducted his standard day-after-game interview session on monday via conference call, so we are left to imagine his body language as he responded to questions about his role in illuminating his new favorite obscure penalty, the call that boosted his jets to a 30-27 overtime victory against new england.did he raise his eyebrows, cock his head and shrug — a ryan special? did he shuffle his feet and gaze at the floor, perhaps toward the patch of skin where his next tattoo, of kicker nick folk, could go? or maybe, just maybe, he pumped his fist, cupped the telephone and mouthed, with an expletive tossed in, ""ha! we got 'em!""that, sadly, would be the unlikeliest of all. but it would also be a fair representation of his feelings toward new england. bullied in five straight meetings, by an average of.2 points, the jets on sunday exacted a measure of revenge that extended beyond the outcome. aside from outplaying the patriots, they outsmarted them. outcoached them, too.when new england defensive tackle chris jones violated a rule implemented before the season by pushing his teammate will svitek into the new orleans saints' field-goal formation last week, no penalty was called; no one among the eight-man officiating crew noticed. the jets did. on sunday, jones employed that same tactic, shoving svitek forward as folk hooked a 56-yard attempt. a penalty flag was thrown immediately by the umpire tony michalek, and the extra 15 yards helped folk drill the winner from 42 yards .""let's just put it this way: we watch every single play,"" said ryan, who declined to say whether he, or a member of his staff, alerted the officials at metlife stadium to watch new england with increased vigilance. in his weekly spot on espn radio, ryan said that his twin, rob, who is the saints' defensive coordinator, did not notify him.""i don't care if it's week 16 or whatever,"" ryan said on the conference call, ""we're going to watch every play of the opponent . that's what we do as coaches."" he added, ""we're aware of opponents' tendencies and everything else.""the patriots' everything else, in particular. for so long, the jets emulated them. they hired eric mangini. they strengthened their secondary as a response to the patriots' collection of receivers and tight ends . they wanted new england's division championships, 10 in 12 years, and three super bowl titles. ryan said last year that he had ""never stopped not thinking about the patriots ."" you get the idea.so, given how closely the jets monitor all intelligence emanating from the belichick bunker — and, in general, how diligently teams prepare for each other — it seemed unlikely that the patriots' technique would go unnoticed another week. it was unclear whether new england's coaches knew about the maneuver; had ordered it, trying to exploit an ambiguity in a new entry to the n.f.l. rule book; or were merely unaware of its nuances.""look, it's our job to understand the rules,"" coach bill belichick said on monday. ""whatever the bottom line is, we didn't do it properly. so, what else is there to say?""according to the transcript provided by the patriots, not much. belichick, for instance, was not asked whether he thought that the jets had tipped off the referee jerome boger — as is their right. it is not an uncommon practice around the league, nor is this an isolated incident in their history with new england. just last season, the jets, alarmed about their difficulty to substitute when the patriots deployed their no-huddle offense, expressed their concerns to the officials .gamesmanship and subterfuge are stalwarts of a rivalry that precedes ryan, dating to bill parcells; to belichick's abrupt resignation as ""hc of the nyj; to the jets' stealthy negotiations — and shrewd offer sheet — that netted curtis martin; to the patriots' clandestine filming of jets defensive signals in, which became the controversy known as spygate.ryan hurled himself into the enmity almost immediately after being hired as the coach in, vowing that he would never kiss belichick's rings. he told his players saturday night that he knew they were better than new england. they just needed to prove it, which they did, with a little assistance from rule, section, article, (b, which states : ""team b players cannot push teammates on the line of scrimmage into the offensive formation.""it was introduced during the off-season, established for player safety measures, the jets, linebacker demario davis said, ""were very aware of that rule."" they were aware of it because when pushing was legal last year, davis said, he was among the players who would ram a lineman into the opposing formation. they were also aware of it because every training camp, officials visit teams to detail rule changes for the coming season, and in early august they arrived at jets camp at suny cortland. there they showed the team a video tutorial — ""what's legal and what's illegal,"" said defensive tackle damon harrison — and answered questions .coaches emphasize the rule changes during camp, officials reinforce them during practice, and players are reminded during the season. in their team meeting every friday, the jets go over the penalties emphasized by that week's crew. last week, the special-teams coach ben kotwica instructed his unit not to push on field-goal attempts .harrison, the player shoved by jones and svitek, noticed the push but said that it did not immediately register to him that new england had committed a penalty.""i don't think guys are out there doing it purposely,"" harrison said, adding, ""i know as a new york jet that we were informed of the rule and that's why we don't do it anymore.""when the fifth question about the infraction was posed to ryan, he seemed to grow a bit impatient. he said he was not worried that the patriots made a mistake because ""we outplayed new england, and i think that's why we won the game.""over the phone, he might have smiled.",818
science,"choteau, mont. — across north america — in places as far-flung as montana and british columbia, new hampshire and minnesota — moose populations are in steep decline. and no one is sure why.twenty years ago, minnesota had two geographically separate moose populations. one of them has virtually disappeared since the 1990s, declining to fewer than 100 from,000.the other population, in northeastern minnesota, is dropping 25 percent a year and is now fewer than,000, down from,000. (the moose mortality rate used to be 8 percent to 12 percent a year.) as a result, wildlife officials have suspended all moose hunting.here in montana, moose hunting permits fell to 362 last year, from 769 in.""something's changed,"" said nicholas decesare, a biologist with the montana department of fish, wildlife and parks who is counting moose in this part of the state — one of numerous efforts across the continent to measure and explain the decline. ""there's fewer moose out there, and hunters are working harder to find them.""what exactly has changed remains a mystery . several factors are clearly at work. but a common thread in most hypotheses is climate change .winters have grown substantially shorter across much of the moose's range. in new hampshire, a longer fall with less snow has greatly increased the number of winter ticks, a devastating parasite. ""you can get,000 ticks on a moose,"" said kristine rines, a biologist with the state's fish and game department.in minnesota, the leading culprits are brain worms and liver flukes. both spend part of their life cycles in snails, which thrive in moist environments.another theory is heat stress. moose are made for cold weather, and when the temperature rises above 23 degrees fahrenheit in winter, as has happened more often in recent years, they expend extra energy to stay cool. that can lead to exhaustion and death.in the cariboo mountains of british columbia, a recent study pinned the decline of moose on the widespread killing of forest by an epidemic of pine bark beetles, which seem to thrive in warmer weather . the loss of trees left the moose exposed to human and animal predators.in smithers, british columbia, in april, a moose — starving and severely infested with ticks — wandered into the flower section of a safeway market . it was euthanized.unregulated hunting may also play a role in moose mortality. so may wolves in minnesota and the west .scientists and officials say other factors could still emerge. because most moose die in the fall, the next few months may provide insight.""it's complicated because there's so many pieces of this puzzle that could be impacted by climate change,"" said erika butler, until recently the wildlife veterinarian at the minnesota department of natural resources .the stakes go beyond the moose themselves. the animals are ecosystem engineers; when they browse shrubs, for example, they create habitat for some nesting birds.and moose contribute to the economy . in new hampshire, for instance, moose-watching tourism is a $115- million -a-year business, according to ms. rines. hunting permits also generate revenue .moose deaths are hard to study, scientists say. the moose is a member of the deer family, but unlike deer it is a solitary animal that does not run in herds, so it can be hard to track. moreover, moose have such high levels of body fat that they decompose rapidly; after 24 hours, a necropsy has little value.in january, minnesota started an unusual.2 million study using advanced monitoring technology to find moose as soon as they die. live animals are captured and fitted with collars that give their location every 15 minutes, and they are given feed containing a tiny transmitter that remains in the body and monitors heart rate and temperature. then the moose are released back into the wild.""if the heart stops beating, it sends a text message to our phone that says, 'i'm dead at x and y coordinates,' "" said dr. butler, who leads the study. the messages are monitored around the clock; when a moose dies, a team on call rushes to the scene by car or helicopter.the winter tick problem in new hampshire is particularly vexing. the animals lose so much blood they can become anemic. worse, the ticks drive the moose crazy; they constantly scratch, tearing off large patches of hair.some moose lose so much hair they look pale, even spectral; some people call them ""ghost moose."" when it rains in the spring, the moose, deprived of their warm coats, then become hypothermic.winter ticks hatch in the fall and begin to climb aboard their host. they are dormant until january or february, when they start to feed, molt into adults and then drop off.moose spend a lot of time feeding in lakes, but wading in water doesn't drown the ticks, which form an air bubble that allows them to survive immersion in water.new hampshire's winter tick problem is a relatively recent phenomenon. but then, so are moose. the animals were hunted out of existence during colonial times; they returned to the state only in the 1970s.while deer have evolved to an ecological balance with ticks, moose have not.deer are grooming animals, so they are able to keep tick numbers fairly low. by contrast, said ms. rines, the biologist, ""moose didn't evolve with ticks, and they don't groom them off."" that has led to swarms of ticks.the solution to the tick problem might be, paradoxically, more moose hunting. ""it's up to the public,"" she said. ""we could kill more if we want healthy moose.""",1041
politics,"washington — senator rand paul, the kentucky republican who is among his party's top 2016 presidential prospects, has found himself accused of plagiarism.but this case has an odd twist. mr. paul appears to have lifted words for a speech this week from a wikipedia entry about a futuristic movie, ""gattaca,"" which imagines a world with a population that has been genetically engineered .the senator was trying to make a point about eugenics, saying the united states was veering dangerously close to eliminating people whom society considered to be undesirable. in doing so, he made a reference to the movie and twice spoke lines that were virtually word for word from the wikipedia description of the plot of ""gattaca,"" which was released in.the speech — which he delivered monday at liberty university in virginia on behalf of the republican candidate for governor, kenneth t. cuccinelli ii — contained this line: ""in the not-too-distant future, eugenics is common, and dna plays a primary role in determining your social class.""the wikipedia entry reads: ""in 'the not-too-distant future,' liberal eugenics is common, and dna plays the primary role in determining social class.""mr. paul's office said in a statement on thursday that the episode was being exaggerated by the senator's enemies. ""only in washington is something this trivial a source for liberal media angst,"" it said.the similarities came to light monday night on ""the rachel maddow show"" on msnbc . the website buzzfeed followed up on tuesday by reviewing other remarks by the senator and said it had found a speech from june in which he appeared to have taken the words to describe another film, ""stand and deliver,"" from wikipedia.accusations of plagiarism are perennial in politics. joseph r. biden jr ., then a senator, ended his 1988 run for the presidency after he was accused of taking words from a speech by the british labour party leader, neil kinnock, without attribution and of plagiarizing an article while he was in law school .and in, hillary rodham clinton's campaign accused barack obama, then a senator, of using language in his speeches that echoed gov . deval patrick of massachusetts .the paul controversy has already been played out in the spirit of wikipedia, whose content is generated and edited by the public. by tuesday, the site's entry on ""gattaca"" had been updated with a reference to the accusations.",1016
politics,"washington — for months, the obama administration has heralded the low premiums of medical insurance policies on sale in the insurance exchanges created by the new health law. but as consumers dig into the details, they are finding that the deductibles and other out-of-pocket costs are often much higher than what is typical in employer-sponsored health plans .until now, it was almost impossible for people using the federal health care website to see the deductible amounts, which consumers pay before coverage kicks in. but federal officials finally relented last week and added a ""window shopping"" feature that displays data on deductibles .for policies offered in the federal exchange, as in many states, the annual deductible often tops,000 for an individual and,000 for a couple. insurers devised the new policies on the assumption that consumers would pick a plan based mainly on price, as reflected in the premium. but insurance plans with lower premiums generally have higher deductibles .in el paso, tex., for example, for a husband and wife both age, one of the cheapest plans on the federal exchange, offered by blue cross and blue shield, has a premium less than $300 a month, but the annual deductible is more than,000. for a 45-year-old couple seeking insurance on the federal exchange in saginaw, mich., a policy with a premium of $515 a month has a deductible of,000.in santa cruz, calif., where the exchange is run by the state, robert aaron, a self-employed 56-year-old engineer, said he was looking for a low-cost plan. the best one he could find had a premium of $488 a month. but the annual deductible was,000, and that, he said, ""sounds really high.""by contrast, according to the kaiser family foundation, the average deductible in employer-sponsored health plans is,135."" deductibles for many plans in the insurance exchanges are pretty high,"" said stan dorn, a health policy expert at the urban institute . ""these plans are more generous than what's prevalent in the current individual insurance market, but significantly less generous than most employer-sponsored insurance .""caroline f. pearson, a vice president of avalere health, a consulting company that has analyzed hundreds of plans, said: ""the premiums are lower than expected, but consumers on the exchange will often face high deductibles and high co-payments for medical services and prescription drugs before they reach the cap on out-of-pocket costs,"" $6,350 for an individual and,700 for a family.those limits provide significant protection, even though those sums are substantial for most consumers . in addition, the federal website, healthcare. gov, informs people that they may qualify for subsidies to reduce their out-of-pocket costs if their household income is below 250 percent of the federal poverty level, meaning that it is less than,725 for an individual or,825 for a family of three.these ""cost-sharing reductions"" are available for a specific kind of midlevel plan known as a silver plan . people with lower incomes can get more help with out-of-pocket costs, but only if they choose silver plans.mr. dorn said the government had not done much to inform people of these potential savings . "" consumers are giving up cost-sharing reductions of enormous value if they enroll in a bronze plan because it has the lowest premium,"" he said.plans in the marketplace are separated into four categories — bronze, silver, gold and platinum — indicating the generosity of coverage, or the share of costs paid by insurance for an average enrollee.many people buying insurance on the federal and state exchanges are expected to qualify for subsidies . but in the first month, for reasons that are not clear, only 30 percent qualified. the others must pay the full premium and will be subject to the full deductible.most people shopping in the exchanges are expected to choose bronze or silver plans, which provide less generous coverage than most employer-sponsored plans.",171
arts,"she is only, but there is already a statue of the glamorous trumpeter alison balsom standing in her hometown, royston, england, where she grew up playing in a brass band.ms. balsom has since become an evangelist for the trumpet, one of few classical musicians to have achieved a successful solo career on the instrument. from the moments when, as a young girl, she heard a record by dizzy gillespie and attended a performance by a virtuoso trumpeter with whom she later studied, ms. balsom never wavered from her desire to be a soloist. she ""pushed her parents into it rather than the other way 'round,"" she said.early on, ms. balsom gained experience performing on radio programs under the auspices of the bbc radio 3 new generation artists program. she has released 12 discs on the emi label. it has taken some imagination on her part to build a career, however, given the limited repertory available.ms. balsom, who plays with an alluring, expressive tone and agile technique on both modern and baroque trumpet, has commissioned new pieces, like james macmillan's ""seraph,"" which she will perform on sunday at town hall with the scottish ensemble, a string orchestra. the program, part of an 11-concert american tour, also features concertos by vivaldi and albinoni, some of the many scores she has transcribed for trumpet. ms. balsom, a lively and engaging interviewee who performed on the david letterman show in, spoke by phone with vivien schweitzer about expanding the repertory and female stereotypes. these are excerpts from the conversation.q. what was your first big break?a. i didn't have a big break, but every time i had anything that looked close to that, i did seize the opportunities with both hands. you're only ever as good as your last concert, and i was extremely conscious of that right from my very first public performances.what's it like not being able to compare yourself to dozens of recordings?it feels very pioneering, although at the beginning of my career the lack of solo repertory seemed like an enormous hurdle that was insurmountable, as we didn't have a brahms, beethoven or mozart writing for the trumpet. i've spent my whole life trying to show how versatile the trumpet can be. it's only limited by your imagination.so how do you program recitals?i want people to leave the concert saying, ""i love the trumpet,"" so the programming is a huge intellectual challenge. and i wasn't always a natural performer onstage, and even now i get nervous.how do you decide which pieces to transcribe for trumpet?i don't tend to go near mozart, as it's perfect and finely balanced as it is, and you have to be careful not to take anything away from a piece. if you think it's musically justifiable, go for it. i think the trumpet is very versatile and like a human voice. music from the baroque era works really well.what are stereotypes about trumpet players?i've been told that it's so unusual to see a girl playing the trumpet. but when i grew up i played in a brass band and my girlfriends played as well. it's only when you're a bit older that you realize that there are gender stereotypes. by that point i was already hooked.what do you enjoy doing in your downtime?i enjoy sailing, but it's not always as glamorous as it sounds. it's cold and freezing, because i sail in britain.",263
politics,"washington — president obama has never visited the rugged mountains of chechnya, but if he digs into one of the novels he bought last weekend, ""a constellation of vital phenomena,"" he will be transported to a land of unremitting violence and tragedy, where the innocent are caught up in war as often as the guilty.perhaps mr. obama is seeking a deeper understanding of the roots of the ethnic bloodletting after chechnya vaulted back to the front pages this year with the boston marathon bombings . or perhaps he is thinking about his troubled relationship with russia.either way, the novel would give the president a more visceral feel for one of the world's most brutal conflicts than the graphic intelligence papers that cross his desk.""i imagine someone in his position gets a lot of facts and figures,"" anthony marra, the author of the book, mused the other day. ""but the novel is really about the experience, about the psyche and the soul.""a reading list offers a rare window into the presidential mind, a peek at what a commander in chief may be thinking about beyond the prosaic and repetitive briefings that dominate his days. the books on the white house night stand provide relief, escape or inspiration. at times they can influence a president's approach to the crises and challenges he confronts.many of the nearly two dozen volumes mr. obama picked up at washington's politics and prose bookstore will be gifts, and certainly children's tales like ""harold and the purple crayon"" offer few lessons for dealing with tea party congressmen . but even if they are given away, some of the books reflect what mr. obama has already read or would like to read. they are volumes about identity and reinvention, about what it means to be american, and about family, love, betrayal and redemption.unlike many of his predecessors, who devoured american history and biographies, mr. obama's tastes lean toward the literary, in keeping with a man whose first memoir deeply explored issues of race and self. while mr. obama has read his share of abraham lincoln, he seems more intent on breaking out, mentally at least, from what harry s. truman once called the crown jewel of the american penal system.one of mr. obama's more intriguing choices was jhumpa lahiri's ""the lowland,"" about two brothers from india, one who comes to build a new life in america and the other who becomes ensnared in politics back home. ms. lahiri said mr. obama may relate to his own conflicting paths as the son of a father from kenya and a mother from kansas .""he has a sort of double vision of america as i do, as many people do, many people who have been both brought up and bred within america but also have a different perspective of the country,"" ms. lahiri said. ""in a sense, part of him comes from outside america and he embodies both that contradiction and that richness.""another presidential choice, julie otsuka's novel ""the buddha in the attic,"" explores issues of immigrants and america as she chronicles the tale of japanese women brought to the united states as ""picture brides"" for migrant workers, only to have their families wind up in world war ii internment camps.""if anyone knows what it's like to be an outsider from very, very difficult circumstances and someone who had to go back and forth between cultures,"" it is mr. obama, ms. otsuka said.the book choices of previous white house occupants offer similar looks into presidential thought.a re-elected richard m. nixon was inspired to ask his cabinet to write letters of resignation after rereading robert blake's biography of benjamin disraeli, said tevi troy, a former aide to george w. bush, who has made a study of what presidents have consumed in popular culture . bill clinton consumed nonfiction, including biography, history and volumes about the emerging information economy of his era.mr. bush was more of a reader than many americans imagined — he had reading contests with karl rove, his top political adviser, measured not just by the number of books finished, but the cumulative number of pages and even square inches of text. he was particularly drawn to lincoln, reading 14 books about the civil war president while in office.his reading at times had impact. natan sharansky's book ""the case for democracy"" helped inform mr. bush's second-term focus on spreading freedom around the world.and alistair horne's history of the war in algeria, ""a savage war of peace,"" taught mr. bush that more people died after the french withdrew — reinforcing his own reluctance to pull out of iraq .""obama's book selections have been harder to read,"" said mr. troy, the author of ""what jefferson read, ike watched, and obama tweeted.""but as he prepares to pull most american troops out of afghanistan next year, mr. obama picked up khaled hosseini's ""the kite runner"" and james salter's evocative ""all that is,"" a story of a world war ii naval officer turned book editor searching for love.mr. marra's book was one of two mr. obama selected set in russia, the other being jason matthews's ""red sparrow,"" a spy thriller in vladimir v. putin's moscow.""you'd think after he picks up the president's daily briefing, the last thing he'd want to read is a spy novel,"" said mr. matthews, who spent 33 years in the c.i.a.mr. obama, who once joked that he had so little time for reading that he just flossed his teeth and watched ""sportscenter,"" also bought nicholas dawidoff's ""collision low crossers,"" about life in the national football league, and david epstein's ""the sports gene,"" about the science of athletic performance.in selecting cheryl strayed's ""wild,"" her memoir of losing her mother, her marriage and almost herself until she takes a thousand-mile backpacking trip along the pacific crest trail, mr. obama may identify with her interior journey.""i think president obama has really searched his soul in the way that writers do,"" ms. strayed said. ""i certainly, like many people, identify with obama's journey. he's really had a lot of people who loved him well, who had a lot of teachers. but he's really a self-made man. so much of 'wild' is about how we ultimately have to make ourselves.""",1459
business,"frankfurt — the european central bank on wednesday outlined the parameters for a wide-ranging review of commercial banks that is designed to expose and fix any problems and ultimately allow credit to begin flowing normally again, a prerequisite for faster economic growth . mario draghi, president of the e.c.b., said the review, which will begin in november and take a year, would be ""an important step forward for europe and for the future of the euro area economy .""european bank stocks fell sharply wednesday as investors apparently concluded that the review would be tougher than they expected, covering a greater range of assets. the euro stoxx banks index closed down.8 percent.the deep dive into bank books is part of a larger attempt to unify europe's fragmented banking system under the supervision of the e.c.b., so that lenders in the single currency zone play by the same rules and meet the same standards.but the e.c.b., with its credibility at stake, must show that it can succeed in eliminating doubts about european banks where other national and european authorities have failed. and it remains unclear who will pay to recapitalize weak banks or how terminally ill banks will be shut down without unleashing market turmoil .""it's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for the e.c.b.,"" said harald benink, a professor of banking and finance at tilburg university in the netherlands. ""they have a clear incentive to be tough.""mr. draghi said in an interview with bloomberg television that the e.c.b. would not hesitate to fail banks in a planned test of their ability to withstand shocks."" banks do need to fail,"" he said. ""the test is credible because the ultimate purpose of it is to restore or strengthen private-sector confidence in the soundness of the banks .""ultimately that's the objective,"" mr. draghi added, ""to have private-sector money to be put into the banking industry .""the review of about 130 large lenders is intended to address one of the underlying problems in the euro zone economy by forcing weak banks to deal with problems such as bad loans or insufficient capital. credit remains tight in much of europe, in part because many banks are burdened with bad loans or because they lack confidence from investors and are unable to raise money on capital markets . without credit a vibrant recovery is almost impossible.the e.c.b. assessment is also a prelude to a significant expansion of the bank's powers, which are already vast. in november, immediately after finishing the review, the e.c.b. will become the bank supervisor for the euro zone, responsible for policing the banking system and guaranteeing its stability .there have been questions about what will happen if the e.c.b. finds banks with grave problems. no one really knows to what extent some banks in italy, spain, germany and other countries may be covering up losses from bad mortgages, business loans or other investments. estimates of potential hidden losses run into the hundreds of billions of euros .""there is fundamental disagreement at the highest european level who is going to absorb losses and who is going to pay to resolve problems,"" mr. benink said. ""if it is not clear who is going to pay these backstops, you cannot have a credible review.""ignazio angeloni, an e.c.b. official overseeing the review, expressed confidence that political leaders will resolve those issues by the time the assessment is finished. ""all of those elements are in the making, and they will fall into place,"" he said at a news conference wednesday.unlike the united states, europe has never really forced banks to confront their problems in a way that rebuilt trust among investors . that was partly because national bank supervisors were overly protective of their own banks . in theory, the e.c.b. would be more willing to put pressure on financial institutions . there are already indications that the threat of e.c.b. scrutiny has ignited a fire under banks and national supervisors .""we expect that this assessment will strengthen private-sector confidence in the soundness of euro area banks and in the quality of their balance sheets,"" mr. draghi said in a statement.",1421
arts,"because american ballet theater's annual eight-week new york spring season occurs at the huge metropolitan opera house and presents an impressive selection of stars, this block of performances has a prestigious spot on the international dance calendar. it's not unusual, however, for the company to squander large parts of the season on works that degrade ballet itself; and so again it proved this year.three-eighths of the season was occupied by ""onegin,"" ""don quixote"" and ""le corsaire,"" which — all infuriating in the way they cheapen their original stories and all laden with dance clichés — show us ballet at its tackiest. the troupe devoted two weeks to "" swan lake "" and ""the sleeping beauty"" in productions unworthy of the company and of the central status those two classics have in the ballet canon. two more weeks were taken by frederick ashton's ""sylvia,"" a wonderful work with a weak story, and kenneth macmillan's "" romeo and juliet,"" a terrific story with too few dance opportunities of real poetry. the most distinguished programs — a triple bill of ballets by mark morris, ashton and george balanchine, and alexei ratmansky's new ""shostakovich trilogy"" — received only four performances each.yet memorable dancing occurred, sometimes even when injuries had thinned the top ranks. the season ended with seven performances of ""beauty,"" six of which i watched. on friday, gillian murphy made every moment count, always using her music feelingly; when being presented with roses in act i, she found time to smell each one before taking a supported pirouette with it. not only is she the only aurora who shows the audience how this role has a large arc, she makes that arc individual. in act i, her aurora is learning to be a princess, still excited by the way everything is happening to her for the first time; in act ii, she's a remote, pure vision but imbued by sorrow.the awakening is usually trite and rushed, but ms. murphy clearly shows us a burning, eager thought process (""that kiss — who?"") before she sees and greets prince désiré (james whiteside, replacing alexandre hammoudi. then, peering over the battlements, she happily registers the court's coming to life and can't wait to introduce désiré to her parents. in act iii, she's regal and playful, caught up in both the private and public aspects of a royal wedding.mr. whiteside's prince is all questing energy . there are aspects of princely dignity he lacks, but they'd probably seem immaterial if he had them; he's an assertive adventurer, applying force of mind rather than refinement or privilege. his partnership with ms. murphy looks increasingly like an exciting meeting of lively investigative minds.aurora and désiré are roles that test artistry as much as technique. although maria kochetkova (on wednesday evening ) was a subdued, lightweight and tentative replacement for alina cojocaru, the superb herman cornejo blazed nobly beside her, both chivalrous and heroic. the new principal hee seo and vadim muntagirov were both elegant on tuesday; there is much detail in the role that she has yet to discover, but the general beauty of her classical style shines here as it does not yet in "" swan lake .""sarah lane (on wednesday afternoon ) brought radiance and sweetness to act i; later, though a good enough executant, she seemed to lose heart. her partner, daniil simkin, is a technician without weight; he's unrewarding to watch when he's standing still.alban lendorf, the young star of the royal danish ballet, made his debut with ballet theater as désiré on saturday afternoon . even at the end of a long season that featured a number of remarkable men, it was at once evident that this is one of the world's most exceptional dancers and a subtle, intelligent and endearing artist. there's a marvelous contrast between his build and his manners: he's stocky, with powerful legs, but his manner is courteous and refined. he tosses off a series of double air turns with ease; what you notice is the luscious depth and fluency of his plié on landing.despite the bravura with which this prince announces himself in this production, mr. lendorf, more than any other interpreter, shows from the first the right element of romantic discontent — the gap in his heart that the ballerina will fill.even so, it was a surprise to see just how happy the awakening and wedding made him; he partnered xiomara reyes not just devotedly but sweetly, as if discovering fun. a marvelous performance. ms. reyes was at her finest, with stylistic delicacies i had not noticed in her before and flair. her fish dives were the season's most exciting, in the whiplash way her raised legs proudly reared back in the air.this sub- disney ""beauty"" has great faults; its fiddly overhaul of marius petipa's choreography for the prologue adagio damages the whole ballet's structure. but thanks to changes large and small, it now repays rewatching as the company's "" swan lake "" does not. the troupe has some distinguished young women at soloist and corps rank. isabella boylston and simone messmer dance with prepossessing skill and maturity; the news that ms. messmer is departing for san francisco ballet is a blow. stella abrera, though unsuited to princess florine, is a most gracious lilac fairy; misty copeland, yuriko kajiya, zhong-jing fang, devon teuscher and leann underwood are also distinctive in solo roles.fine performances emerged in nondance parts, too. the company now appreciates that the two mime roles of catalabutte, the overworked and forgetful master of ceremonies, and his assistant, herald, do much to set the tone for the prologue and act i. in this production, staged by kevin mckenzie, gelsey kirkland and michael chernov, their various fusses become funny, like incidents in lewis carroll's ""alice"" books. i especially relished the catalabutte of julio bragado-young, while the performances of joseph gorak and arron scott as the herald were engagingly vivid.as king florestan, roman zhurbin was extraordinary, making tiny moments of thought or reaction momentous in their expressive depth. nancy raffa was a dangerous, waspish carabosse. these ""beauty"" performances showed ballet theater's artists deepening their understanding of what both this ballet and they themselves can be.",1176
arts,"this was the year that prose turned purple, binge viewing trumped appointment television, and ""scandal"" took the place of "" breaking bad "" as the hot drama everyone wanted to talk about. television is still in a golden age, but the best of 2013 looked a little brassy, more aaron spelling than aaron sorkin. netflix offered a version of ""scandal"" in 'house of cards,' a washington soap opera for the downloading elite that was more sleek and sophisticated on the surface but was really just as juicy and lowbrow as shonda rhimes's drama on abc .and in its third season, 'scandal' kept a straight face through a nuclear proliferation of preposterous plot twists. the government misdeeds in this amped-up melodrama are so dire and so bountiful they could fill a ""twelve days of christmas"" carol (seven assassins stabbing, six senators sexting, five golden stings. the writing is just as extreme: characters declaim in identical overwrought rants. abc, not surprisingly, doubled down on schlock and awe. the second season of 'revenge,' which is set in the hamptons and is supposedly based on the dumas novel ""the count of monte cristo,"" mostly seemed infused by montecristo cigars. 'nashville,' a variation on ""dynasty"" set in the world of country-western music, also made some noise.on the other hand, there was a deadly silence surrounding the network's more solemn, slow-moving drama, 'betrayal.' that show took marital infidelity much more seriously and was a big bore. abc has decided to replace it in january with ""killer women,"" a procedural about a sexy texas ranger (and former pageant winner) who hunts down women wanted for murder.the profusion of flashy escapist shows all but drowned out more sober and high-minded options. although the audience grew some, viewers didn't embrace the virtue and verbal virtuosity of 'the newsroom' on hbo, even after mr. sorkin fine-tuned his characters for the second season.there wasn't much more patience for artsy, self-serious crime dramas like 'low winter sun,' on amc, 'ray donovan' on showtime or, on sundance, jane campion's slow-moving thriller 'top of the lake.' cable and internet networks are slower to admit defeat than the broadcast networks . 'the killing,' which staggered through a third season on amc, should have gotten axed but instead has won a fourth season and yet another chance on netflix . yet another adaptation of a cult scandinavian drama, the turgid fx show 'the bridge,' was renewed for a second season. film noir paled to ashen gray and was shown up by 'orange is the new black.' this netflix original series became the new de rigueur crime -doesn't-pay show, even though it is not nearly as grim and complex as 'breaking bad,' which ended its five-season run on amc in one last apocalyptic blood bath. ""orange is the new black"" is a frisky semi-comical drama about a pretty, blond, middle-class woman who is put behind bars and consorts with less genteel inmates — ""clueless"" goes correctional.in its fifth season, 'the good wife' picked up fresh steam, mostly by favoring office politics over gubernatorial campaigns: alicia (julianna margulies) defected from lockhart/gardner to form her own firm, taking some prized clients with her and leaving behind an angry and vengeful former lover, will (josh charles. this show started out as a fictionalized reinterpretation of the eliot spitzer scandal but has found its own course as a legal drama spiced with lots of sex and heavy breathing.the ""scandal""-ization of prime time extended even to 'homeland.' the showtime espionage thriller, starring claire danes as carrie, a bipolar c.i.a. officer, is so somber and forbidding that it kept carrie's lover, brody (damian lewis, off-screen and out of her way for much of the season. yet for all the repression and restraint, even that series turned a little sudsy at times. the show found plenty of time for family melodrama, particularly in the teenage sulking of brody's daughter.mostly, the real holdouts were in the fantasy and horror fields.

""just a bounce here or there — it's been that way the whole series.""if the rangers win game, they will return here for game 7 on monday night . each team has won its home games. brian boyle scored the rangers' goal off a feed from derick brassard on the game's first shift, and it looked as if the rangers were on their way. it was boyle's second goal of the series. for brassard, the top scorer of the series, it was his fifth assist and sixth point.the rangers controlled the game's first 27 minutes but could not increase their lead, partly because their power play went 0 for.boyle and brassard seemed poised to be the rangers' heroes. but in the end, each was partly responsible for a capitals goal.boyle's fall from grace came:33 into the second period, when he responded to a shove from ribeiro with a two-handed slash. on the ensuing power play, joel ward finished a two-pass setup, leveling the score at.""it's a dumb penalty — you don't kill those off,"" rangers coach john tortorella said. ""and that's a guy that's playing well for us, but it's a dumb penalty.""that put an end to the rangers' momentum: from that point on, it was largely the capitals' game.the rangers were on their heels through much of the third period, when they were outshot, 13-4. at:35, lundqvist barely got the tip of his glove to a john carlson slap shot, changing its trajectory just enough that it rang off the crossbar.with one second left in regulation, carlson took another huge slap shot, but mats zuccarello made a sliding block, saving lundqvist and sending the game to overtime.both teams had chances in the extra session. dan girardi cleared a loose puck out of lundqvist's crease, and lundqvist stopped a break-in by mathieu perreault with his left pad. braden holtby, who finished with 24 saves, stopped a wraparound try by rick nash — practically the only offensive threat of the game from nash, the rangers' snakebit scoring star. nash finished with only two shots on goal, as well as an additional attempt that was blocked. he has one assist for the series. alex ovechkin, another struggling scoring star, was far more active for the capitals . he finished with a game-high nine shots on goal, and an additional six attempts that were blocked. nevertheless, he stayed stuck on one goal and one assist for the series.brassard's miscue came in overtime, when his attempted clearance did not make it out of the rangers' zone. the puck went to capitals defenseman karl alzner, whose slap shot from the point deflected off teammate troy brouwer and then off the skate of rangers defenseman anton stralman. from there the puck nestled right on the stick of ribeiro, standing in front of the goal, and he swept it past a sprawling lundqvist.""next time i've got to make sure the puck is out, and if the puck is out there, it's probably a different situation right now,"" brassard said.the situation is a do-or-die game 6 for the rangers .""we'll respond fine,"" ryan callahan said. ""we've got a lot of character in here. guys here have been through this before.""in last season's opening round, the rangers rallied from a 3-2 series deficit and beat the ottawa senators in seven games. rangers forward ryane clowe left the game in the first period after being boarded by the capitals' jason chimera, who received a penalty. clowe, whose head hit the glass on the check, was playing his second game after returning from an unspecified injury, believed to be a concussion. if clowe is unable to play game, chris kreider, a playoff hero for the rangers last spring, is most likely to take his place.",649

""it was an amazing two days for me.""so on monday at tumble creek golf course in cle elum, wash., he will play 36 holes, as he did a year ago, with a spot in the field for next week's united states open on the line.""i enjoyed last year,"" said martin, who had not played tournament golf for eight years. ""and i feel like i'm playing well, not competitively but on my own, so i'll try to qualify again. that's why they call it the open.""martin is best known for his lawsuit against the pga tour, under the americans with disabilities act, which won him the right to use a cart in competition in. but few knew that martin, who has a degenerative circulatory disorder in his right leg called klippel-trenaunay-weber syndrome, had stopped playing full time in. he became the golf coach at the university of oregon in, taking a job in his hometown, eugene.""tour life is great when you're doing well,"" he said in a telephone interview . ""but when you're single and not playing well, not so much. it had taken me a while just to get there. and i'd had enough.""martin had happily escaped the public eye . he said that using a cart on the pga tour was mentally grueling, not only because of the scrutiny, but also because he had to drive among spectators while his competitors walked between the ropes.an admittedly relentless competitor, martin channeled his energy into the oregon program, trying to recruit top amateur golfers to eugene, where it rains about 51 inches a year. in, the ducks played in an n.c.a.a. semifinal, losing to the perennial power oklahoma state . oregon also tied for third last year.""i have had times where i've signed players,"" oklahoma state coach mike mcgraw said, ""and i'll get a call from casey the morning after, and i'll be left trying to figure out how he even heard about it. he's on top of everything.""watching his players on the range and in competition increased martin's voracious interest in the golf swing, not that he wanted to tinker with theirs. but if they struggled, he wanted to know why and to be able to turn them around quickly.although he never stopped pounding balls on the range — mostly with his driver before the ducks reported for practice — martin never played in events more competitive than alumni fund-raisers or a friendly nassau. until may.""his game, especially his ball striking, was just incredible from the beginning,"" said josh unruh, a friend and former oregon assistant men's basketball coach, who was martin's caddie through local and sectional qualifying last year and will be on his bag monday. ""but i wondered if he could get through the 36 holes of sectionals.""martin's right leg is atrophied, and it throbs day and night. so even though he used a cart during qualifiers and at the open, hitting so many shots was painful. the weather did not help.""we were in the last group to tee off,"" unruh said. ""he played the first 18 holes at three under and birdied the first hole of the second round when the rain got biblical. there was a two-hour delay, where we saw he was tied for the lead. but he probably should have stopped after 15 holes because it was getting dark. he ended up needing to make a 5- foot putt in the dark on 18 to avoid a playoff. and he made it.""it was as if martin had stoked a fire. at the open, he tied for 60th, one stroke below the cut line. his two-day score was the same as players like lucas glover, a former united states open champion, and louis oosthuizen, a former british open winner.and as martin likes to point out, ""i can say i beat rory mcilroy .""martin, who recently had a painful kidney stone procedure, knows the sectional will not be easy. only the two lowest scorers in the 34-player field will qualify for the open, which begins june 13 at merion golf club in ardmore, pa.to that end, he has been working with the swing coaches joe mayo and grant waite. martin maintains that he is hitting the ball better than when he was a full-time professional. in local qualifying in portland, ore., martin shot a 69 and beat a few of the players he coaches.""i'm excited to try and take some of that new knowledge out there,"" martin said.

sports,"chicago — sweat still dripped from the chicago blackhawks ' playoff beards after their game 7 overtime win over the detroit red wings on wednesday as they described the thrill of overcoming a three-games-to-one deficit .but while the victory was exhilarating, the blackhawks soon turned their attention to their next daunting challenge: a western conference finals matchup against the defending champion los angeles kings, led by goaltender jonathan quick, last season's conn smythe trophy winner as the most valuable player of the playoffs.during the kings' run to the stanley cup in, quick allowed.41 goals per game and posted a.946 save percentage . this postseason, he has been just as good and maybe better, with a.50 goals against average, a.948 save percentage and 3 shutouts. quick is the fulcrum of a defense that has allowed more than two goals only twice in 13 playoff games and never more than three.in game 7 of los angeles's second-round series against san jose, quick stopped 25 shots to preserve a 2-1 win, including a remarkable sprawling glove save against joe pavelski late in the third period on what looked to be a sure goal.""that's what he does,"" blackhawks wing viktor stalberg said. ""sometimes guys think they have an empty net, and somehow he finds his way back there.""after practicing friday, the blackhawks were full of praise for quick. marian hossa spoke of quick's aggressiveness in coming out of his crease to cut down shooting angles. patrick kane noted his low positioning, allowing him to see through tangles of bodies in front of the net. coach joel quenneville called quick a special player.""we have our work cut out,"" kane said.the blackhawks' attempt to disrupt quick will begin saturday at united center . the key to almost every tactic, they said, is sending bodies to the front of the net.""you say it against every goalie, but you want to get traffic,"" kane said. quenneville added, ""a lot of our talk looking at the series and tomorrow's game is we have to find a way to make sure he doesn't see pucks.""hossa suggested that one-timers could be effective in getting quick to move from side to side in his crease. kane said that elevating the puck could be an answer to quick's crouch.the sharks made a concerted effort to get physical with quick. they bumped, poked and jostled him frequently. the contact appeared to frustrate quick during games 3 and, both sharks wins in san jose . chicago had similar success against detroit's jimmy howard .""the way he played, you see that if you don't get bodies, if you don't get traffic going towards the goalie, he's going to make saves,"" stalberg said of howard. ""same deal with quick."" chicago averaged.1 goals per game in the regular season, leading the western conference . the blackhawks were 2-1 against the kings, scoring five, four and three goals.but no one in chicago's locker room wanted to put much stock in those results. los angeles is a different team, and so is chicago, the blackhawks said.""a lot of people still want to talk about our accomplishments during the regular season,"" the captain jonathan toews said. ""but teams that we're up against would love to knock us out of the playoffs and show us it really doesn't matter.""despite film study sessions and meticulous preparation, many players acknowledged that to score consistently on quick, they would also need a bit of luck : a bounce off a skate or a deflection off a stick would be just as important as any x's and o's.""i don't think many pucks are going to beat him cleanly,"" stalberg said.

arts,"it took a powerful, disturbing dream from which she awoke sobbing to convince robin charboneau, an oglala sioux and member of north dakota's spirit lake tribe, that ""i needed to open my mouth, and i needed to speak."" so she let the documentary filmmaker david sutherland follow her for more than three years as she struggled to raise her family as a single mother while confronting her alcoholism and the scars of being sexually abused as a child.what she did not know was that her decision would temporarily cost her custody of her two children in tribal court, or that her teenage daughter would disclose that she too had been sexually abused — by her own father, a development that led to a federal trial and, for the filmmaker and the producers, ethical soul searching .ms. charboneau's story and that of her children — darian, now, and anthony, 14 — unspool in mr. sutherland's ""kind hearted woman,"" a five-hour presentation on the pbs series ""frontline"" and ""independent lens"" on april 1 and. like mr. sutherland's 1998 film ""the farmer's wife,"" chronicling the challenges of a nebraska farm couple, and the 2006 ""country boys,"" which follows two high school students in appalachia, ""kind hearted woman"" is a detailed portrait of the kind of lives rarely given a media spotlight, those lived on the margins of rural america, where money and education are scarce.mr. sutherland, 67, set out to deal with the subject of abuse, he said in an interview in his boston sound-mixing studio. but he too stumbled into a much more complex story than the small-scale human drama he anticipated. now, two years after he finished filming, his work can be seen as something of an exhibit a in explaining why the federal bureau of indian affairs took control of social services on the spirit lake indian reservation last year, citing concerns that tribal mismanagement had led to abuse of children there.the film almost didn't get made. after ""country boys"" mr. sutherland took a break from filmmaking until receiving fan mail from patricia harrison, the chief executive of the corporation for public broadcasting, which administers federal funds for public broadcasting . he said it spurred him back to his cameras and microphones, which capture the extraordinarily rich sound that distinguishes his work. (the corporation later supported the film with a substantial grant.)during his initial hunt for a subject, mr. sutherland said, he had no plans to focus on american indians, but his research led him to ms. charboneau, now.as a ""portraitist,"" he said, ""all i'm going for is to put a face on a family that happens to be native. i want you to feel like you're in their skin."" ms. charboneau said in a phone interview that at the time mr. sutherland was only the third person she had told about her sexual abuse .he initially believed the film, which began shooting in, would focus on ms. charboneau's efforts to get sober and continue her education . but raney aronson-rath, the deputy executive producer of ""frontline,"" said that the news ""caught up with david"" after the editing started in. early on, she said, even though the filmmakers felt there was a bigger story to be told about the tribal court system — shown through ms. charboneau's interactions with it — ""we didn't understand the systemic nature of what was going on at spirit lake"" until the federal takeover late last summer. the documentary does not refer to that intervention because mr. sutherland's portrait was already complete.often, ms. aronson-rath said, the opposite chain of events happens with documentaries : a wider news event or scandal breaks, and producers scramble to find a character to put an empathetic face on the broader story. but whenever the news does catch up to a documentary as it is being made, ""it's because we're on the right issues,"" said michael sullivan, a former executive producer of special projects at ""frontline,"" who oversaw mr. sutherland's films until leaving the program in february. in this case, separate from the documentary, ""frontline"" assigned a reporter, sarah childress, to cover the intervention for the show's web site .more problematic for the filmmakers was that early on in the filming darian made a wrenching charge: her father, anthony charboneau iii, had sexually abused her.as a filmmaker, said lois vossen, the series producer of ""independent lens,"" ""your natural instinct is to want to use that."" at the same time ""you want to help somebody, not put them in harm's way.""when editing got under way, ms. aronson-rath said, ""we had a really robust editorial discussion around both darian and also her brother. we thought long and hard about it. we listened to david sutherland for days and days and days about his decision making and the level of access that he had and the trust that he had built between them. and we were convinced that there was a real trust there, that robin was acting on behalf of her children in a way that was responsible, from what we could tell.""eventually, darian's revelation became the film's centerpiece, along with her father's subsequent trial and conviction.mr. sutherland, in an exception to normal ""frontline"" rules, shows his finished films to his subjects in advance; darian could have objected then, the producers noted. ""darian is always fairly direct,"" mr. sutherland said.as a minor darian had the right to withhold consent for the use of the abuse material, mr. sullivan of frontline said, adding, ""we were always gambling a bit that the footage would remain in the film .""in a telephone interview darian said she at first embraced the filming, which started when she was. ""i thought it was pretty cool because i thought we were going to be famous,"" she said. but as she got older, ""it started to dawn on me what it was really going to be like, that my personal life was going to be shown out there more. i was more scared what people would think of me, if i would lose people because of it."" for several months she forbade mr. sutherland to film her. in the end ""i'm all right with it,"" she said. ""i don't regret my story being out there. i am hoping it could help girls my age.""still, the producers have gone to pains to prepare the family for the consequences of a national broadcast. when ""the farmer's wife"" was shown, it drew donations of everything from carpeting for that family's house to a trip to disney world to braces for the title character . ""you suddenly go from being a private person to a public person,"" ms. vossen said.ms. charboneau seems to have already made that leap. she has written a statement to other abuse victims and will participate in outreach efforts connected to the film . once she committed to mr. sutherland's documentary, she decided, ""whatever happens in the process of filming, if it helps that one woman — if it helps her get out — then it's worth it,"" she said. ""it's worth whatever i have to give.""",1473
politics,"washington — twice in recent years, the supreme court rebuked the federal appeals court in atlanta for its rigid attitude toward filing deadlines in capital cases . the appeals court does not seem to be listening.a few days after christmas, a divided three-judge panel of the court ruled that ronald b. smith, a death row inmate in alabama, could not pursue a challenge to his conviction and sentence because he had not ""properly filed"" a document by a certain deadline.as it happens, there is no dispute that the document was filed on time. but it was not ""properly filed,"" the majority said, because mr. smith's lawyer did not at the same time pay the $154 filing fee or file a motion to establish something also not in dispute — that his client was indigent.nor did the majority place much weight on the fact that the lawyer himself was on probation for public intoxication and was addicted to crystal methamphetamine while he was being less than punctilious. in the months that followed, the lawyer would be charged with drug possession, declare bankruptcy and commit suicide.mr. smith is almost surely guilty of murdering a convenience store clerk in 1994 in huntsville, ala. but it is not clear that he deserves to die for his crime .his jury, by a vote of seven to five, determined that the murder did not warrant the death penalty, recommending instead that mr. smith be sentenced to life in prison .but the alabama capital justice system has many idiosyncrasies. one of them is that it allows judges to override such recommendations. the judge rejected the jury's recommendation and sentenced mr. smith to death.only two other states, delaware and florida, allow such overrides . but it has been decades since anyone was sentenced to death in either state after a jury recommended a life term.since, alabama judges have rejected sentencing recommendations from capital juries 110 times, according to data compiled by the equal justice initiative, a nonprofit law firm that represents poor people and prisoners. in 100 of those cases, judges imposed the death penalty after juries had called for a life sentence. the most recent override in the direction of death was in september.the supreme court considered the quality of alabama's capital justice system in a blown-deadline case last year and did not seem impressed.""nearly alone among the states, alabama does not guarantee representation to indigent capital defendants in post-conviction proceedings,"" justice ruth bader ginsburg wrote for a seven- justice majority in maples v. thomas. ""on occasion, some prisoners sentenced to death receive no post-conviction representation at all.""that case involved cory r. maples, an alabama death row inmate who missed a filing deadline because of a mix-up in the mailroom of a prominent new york law firm, sullivan & cromwell.mr. maples's lawyers had done more than neglect to attach a check to their legal papers; they missed the deadline completely.they were, moreover, working at one of the most prestigious firms in the nation. ""i have little doubt that the vast majority of criminal defendants would think that they had won the lottery if they were given the opportunity to be represented by attorneys from such a firm,"" justice samuel a. alito jr . wrote of sullivan & cromwell in a concurrence.now consider mr. smith's lawyer, c. wade johnson, who was battling a crippling drug addiction throughout his representation of mr. smith. according to a sworn statement from his legal assistant, mr. johnson would often turn up at the office intoxicated and sometimes had to be roused at home and taken to court appearances .by the time of the deadline at issue, in, mr. johnson had twice been arrested, for public intoxication and drug possession . less than a month after the deadline, mr. johnson was rushed to the hospital while visiting a client in prison, leaving his dog locked in his car.in the process of freeing the dog, officials found a bag of crystal meth, which led to more drug charges . mr. johnson's fortunes spiraled further from there, and he took his own life in.the majority in mr. smith's case wrote that all of this might suffice to excuse the incomplete filing were it not for a second lawyer's involvement in the case . but that lawyer was based in tennessee and was not authorized to practice law in alabama . judge rosemary barkett dissented, saying she did not see how the case was materially different from that of mr. maples or a 2010 rebuke from the supreme court to her court . in that second case, a florida death row inmate named albert holland was given a new opportunity to argue that his lawyer's inaccessibility and incompetence had caused him to miss a deadline. in a concurrence in april in yet another blown-deadline case, judge barkett identified the larger question that runs through these cases: why is it morally permissible to blame clients for their lawyers' mistakes?the legal system generally answers by saying that lawyers are their clients' agents. the answer makes perfect sense when you are talking about sophisticated clients who choose their lawyers, supervise their work and fire them if they turn out to be incompetent or worse.but the theory turns problematic, judge barkett wrote, when the clients are on death row, have no role in the selection of their lawyers and have no real control over them.allowing mr. smith's challenge to be heard in a federal court does not mean he would prevail. but, judge barkett said, he ought to be allowed to make his case .

science,"cape canaveral, fla. — nasa is headed back to the moon, this time to explore its thin atmosphere and rough dust.the robotic spacecraft ladee (pronounced la'-dee, will fly to the moon by way of virginia's eastern shore .liftoff is set for late friday night from nasa's wallops flight facility. weather permitting, the soaring minotaur rocket should be visible along much of the east coast — as far south as south carolina, as far north as maine and as far west as pittsburgh .ladee — short for lunar atmosphere and dust environment explorer — will be the first spacecraft to be launched into outer space from wallops. and it will be the first moonshot ever from virginia in 54 years of lunar missions .the unmanned minotaur rocket consists of converted intercontinental ballistic missile motors. a peace treaty between the united states and russia specifies the acceptable launch sites for those missile parts; wallops is on that short list .all but one of nasa's approximately 40 moon missions — most memorably the manned apollo flights of the late 1960s and early 1970s — originated from cape canaveral . the most recent were the twin grail spacecraft launched two years ago this weekend. the lone exception, clementine, a military -nasa venture, rocketed away from southern california in.scientists involved in the $280 million, moon-orbiting mission want to examine the lunar atmosphere — yes, that's right, the moon's atmosphere.""sometimes, people are a little taken aback when we start talking about the lunar atmosphere because, right, we were told in school that the moon doesn't have an atmosphere,"" said sarah noble, nasa program scientist.""it does. it's just really, really thin.""the atmosphere is so thin and delicate, in fact, that spacecraft landings can disturb it. so now is the time to go, noble said, before other countries and even private companies start bombarding the moon and fouling up the atmosphere.just last week, china announced plans to launch a lunar lander by year's end .there's evidence mercury also has a tenuous atmosphere, where, like our moon, the atmospheric molecules are so sparse that they never collide. some moons of other planets also fall into that category, as do some big asteroids.earth's moon is relatively close, and by studying its atmosphere, scientists will learn about similar atmospheres in places farther afield, noble said.scientists also are eager to measure the lunar dust and see whether the abrasive, equipment-clogging particles actually levitate right off the surface. none of the previous moon missions focused exclusively on the atmosphere and dust.it will take ladee — the size of a small car coming in under,000 pounds — one month to get close enough to the moon to go into lunar orbit, followed by another month to check its three scientific instruments. then the spacecraft will be maneuvered from 30 miles to 90 miles above the lunar surface, where it will collect data for just over three months.the mission will last six months and end with a suicide plunge into the moon.nasa is inviting amateur astronomers to keep an eye out for any meteoric impacts on the moon once ladee arrives there on oct. 6. such information will help scientists understand the effect of impacts on the lunar atmosphere and dust environment.hitching a ride on ladee is an experimental laser communication system designed to handle higher data rates than currently available. nasa hopes to eventually replace its traditional radio systems with laser communications, which uses less power and requires smaller transmitters and receivers, while providing lightning-fast bandwidth .nasa was hot on the lunar trail when it announced the ladee mission in. but the effort to return astronauts to the moon was canceled by president barack obama in.the latest target destinations for human explorers: an asteroid, then mars. the debate continues as to whether the moon is a more practical starting point .the air force minotaur v rocket was built by orbital sciences corp. the virginia-based company is scheduled to make its first-ever supply run to the international space station in just two weeks, using its own antares rocket . wallops will host that launch as well.",273
politics,"washington — president obama on wednesday nominated sally jewell, the chief executive of recreational equipment inc., to lead the interior department, with a vow that she will balance the agency's sometimes conflicting mandates to promote resource development and preserve the nation's natural heritage.if confirmed, ms. jewell, a former oil company engineer and longtime advocate for conservation and outdoor recreation, will take over a department that has been embroiled in controversy over the regulation of oil and gas on public lands and in the gulf of mexico and arctic ocean . she also will be the steward of hundreds of millions of acres of public lands, from the everglades of florida to the cascades of washington state .ms. jewell, 56, who also had a 19-year career as a commercial banker, took over as chief executive of rei in. the company, which is based in kent, wash., just south of seattle, has since grown to nearly $2 billion a year in sales.she is in line to replace ken salazar, who has led the department since the beginning of the obama administration .the president must also fill vacancies at other major agencies that deal with energy and environmental issues — at the energy and transportation departments and the environmental protection agency . the white house gave no indication on wednesday that any of those appointments are imminent.while introducing ms. jewell at the white house, mr. obama alluded to the tensions that have divided the interior department's mission for decades. he said that she is an expert on energy and climate change issues as well as an avid outdoorswoman and a former oil company worker in oklahoma and colorado .""she knows the link between conservation and good jobs,"" the president said. ""she knows that there's no contradiction between being good stewards of the land and our economic progress, that, in fact, those two things need to go hand in hand.""ms. jewell spoke briefly, saying she was humbled and energized by the appointment and looked forward to meeting the senators who will vote on her confirmation.she can expect sharp questioning during those hearings about her approach to resource development — oil, gas and minerals, but also solar and wind power — on public lands . republicans in congress have criticized the obama administration for holding back public lands from oil and gas leasing and for imposing overly restrictive regulations on hydraulic fracturing and other extraction methods. senator lisa murkowski of alaska, the senior republican on the energy and natural resources committee, said she was not yet ready to judge ms. jewell's credentials. ""i look forward to hearing about the qualifications ms. jewell has that make her a suitable candidate to run such an important agency, and how she plans to restore balance to the interior department,"" ms. murkowski said in a statement.ms. jewell will also face scrutiny from environmental and conservation advocates who will want to know about her approach to the preservation of public lands .ms. jewell, a native of the seattle area and a graduate of the university of washington with a degree in mechanical engineering, has been a lifelong outdoors enthusiast. as a child she sailed in the puget sound and camped throughout the pacific northwest, according to a 2005 profile in the seattle times .in, she introduced president obama at the white house conference on ""america's great outdoor initiative,"" noting that the $289 billion outdoor-recreation industry is the source of.5 million jobs .ms. jewell and her husband, warren, have made political contributions of nearly,000 since the mid-1990s, almost exclusively to democratic candidates and causes. she contributed to two groups that supported the successful 2012 effort to legalize same-sex marriage in washington state . the interior department post has traditionally gone to a politician from the western united states, like mr. salazar, a former senator from colorado . under president george w . bush, gale a. norton, a former attorney general of colorado, and dirk kempthorne, a former governor and senator from idaho, served in the position.ms. jewell, if confirmed, would represent a different model, a corporate executive with experience in both resource exploitation and conservation.douglas w. walker, a former chairman of the board at rei and a climbing partner of ms. jewell's, said she is an avid climber, kayaker and sailor who has climbed mount rainier in washington state and mount vinson in antarctica.""and when sally is confirmed, i'm willing to bet that she will be the first secretary of the interior who frequently hikes mailbox peak in her native washington state and who once spent a month climbing mountains in antarctica,"" he said, ""which is just not something i'd think of doing, because it seems like it'd be cold, and i was born in hawaii .""",1265
science,"los angeles (ap) — the face of mars is dotted with a maze of channels, pointing to possible ancient megaflood episodes.now scientists peering below the surface have uncovered the first evidence of underground channels apparently created by flooding — a finding that's expected to further illuminate the role of water in mars' history.using a ground-piercing radar sensor aboard the mars reconnaissance orbiter, a team of scientists created 3-d maps of an equatorial region known as elysium planitia and the channels that run underneath the plains.besides the contributions from rovers and landers, ""our view of the red planet has largely been restricted to looking at the surface"" from orbiting spacecraft, said lead researcher gareth morgan, a planetary scientist at the smithsonian institution .the research, published online thursday in the journal science, offers a new perspective below the martian surface and hints of past flooding at a time when the planet was mostly thought to be cold and desert-like. the channels remained hidden because the once volcanically active region had been filled in by lava flows hundreds of millions years ago .dry channels on the martian surface were first spied by mariner 9 in. later observations by the viking spacecraft suggested the geologic features were likely carved by water. mars missions since then have used sophisticated instruments to image these winding channels .the latest 3-d maps, painstakingly pieced together from radar data collected by numerous spacecraft passes, have already changed scientists' notions: the channels are deeper than expected, a sign that flooding was more extensive than generally believed.morgan said the origin of the ancient floodwaters likely came from a deep reservoir and were possibly unleashed by a volcanic eruption.brown university mars expert john mustard called the new work ""totally cool and significant.""""it shows a completely new dimension for considering the evolution of mars,"" mustard, who was not part of the study, said in an email.",537
politics,"miami — after two months of false starts, error messages and pleas for patience from the once-hobbled federal online health care exchange, karen egozi, the chief executive of the epilepsy foundation of florida, watched on monday as counselors navigated the website's pages with relative ease.click. next page. click. next page. the website, healthcare. gov, was working so well that ms. egozi, who oversees the 45 navigators in eight locations who help consumers enroll in health plans, said her team gave the system an 8 on a scale of 1 to, meaning that most people got as far as selecting a plan or taking home information to select a plan. it felt like a champagne moment.""i'm 80 percent satisfied,"" ms. egozi said. ""i think it will be great when it's 100 percent.""a little over a week after the deadline that president obama gave for fixing the federal health care exchange, the system is definitely working better, according to consumers and navigators interviewed in several states . the technical errors that had bedeviled visitors to the site for weeks seemed to have been tamed by the patchwork of hardware and software fixes ordered by the administration, and applicants were finally selecting health care plans under the president's new law, the affordable care act . by last week, the number of applicants who dropped a plan into their virtual grocery carts was climbing at a rapid clip.still, the interviews indicated, some technical obstacles persist. after shoppers clicked all the way to the plans, for example, the system was not letting some people actually choose one. in other cases, people were asked to try again later.improved entry into the online marketplace has also exposed a new layer of problems and confusion for applicants who are suddenly finding their efforts to buy insurance delayed by requirements that they provide proof of identity or citizenship or that they wait for determinations on medicaid eligibility.for the most part, though, the news for the beleaguered online exchange, which serves 36 states, is improving. since early december, the federal exchange website has run without crashing, officials said. in the first week of december, about,000 people selected plans — compared with about,000 in all of november and only,000 in october. last week, more than half a million people created accounts on the federal website, according to people familiar with the health care project.technical experts involved with the exchange said they are now preparing for a surge of applications before dec. 23, the enrollment deadline to receive coverage by the first of the year. although those preparations will require some significant changes to the system, the work will be easier now that the site seems stable during heavy use, the experts said.in offices spread across the country, from florida and pennsylvania to wyoming and wisconsin, all of them states that rely on the federal government's insurance exchange, navigators and applicants reported far fewer problems.""i was hearing so much about the glitches in the system that i was worried that it wouldn't work,"" said caroline moseley, 54, who lost her job as a housing program analyst for the city of philadelphia . after asking a navigator from the nonprofit resources for human development for help in finding a plan, ms. moseley chose one that costs $27 a month with a,000 deductible. ""it was a great experience,"" she said. ""the site was running very smoothly. it took about 30 minutes tops.""stephanie lincoln, 60, of lansdowne, pa., also had quick success with the exchange — after a frustrating experience trying to submit an application online in october and november. with the help of a navigator, caroline picher, working at the local library, ms. lincoln signed up in just one hour on friday for a policy that will cost $113 a month, with no deductible.""i am one of the people whose plans were canceled,"" ms. lincoln said. ""it was just the easiest thing in the world.""but the smoother functioning of the website has also brought to light new kinds of delays that are creating anxieties for some of the people rushing to buy insurance by the december 23 deadline .at wyoming senior citizens in riverton, wyo., four people walked in on thursday and friday and completed their applications with the help of counselors. after they successfully entered their personal information, the system displayed a message saying they needed to check if they qualified for medicaid, said karla borders, a navigator at the center.",1422
business,"tokyo — the pink toyota crown sedan that took center stage at a holiday event here last week was meant to shock, and it did.the crown, the preferred ride of staid japanese executives, had received an edgy makeover. with a new oversize grille, vamped-up hybrid engine and an unveiling at a fashion mall, there was nothing stodgy about this car.""my initial reaction was: 'you're kidding! please, not pink,' "" akio toyoda, the toyota chief executive and a scion of the japanese automaker's founding family, told reporters at the event. ""but being reborn does mean taking on new challenges.""toyota has spent much of the last year trying to leave behind what has been a tumultuous four years in which the automaker booked its largest loss ever, became embroiled in a recall scandal, struggled with a decimated supply chain after the 2011 tsunami and weathered the punishing effects of a strong yen .one by one, the pieces have been falling into place.in, toyota leapfrogged general motors and volkswagen to regain its title as the world's largest automaker, selling.7 million vehicles, a record for the company . now the company is on the cusp of a recovery, analysts say, that could put it on track to post the kind of growth promised before the crises .""toyota is now in the position — for the first time in years — where it is beating market expectations while its peers are disappointing,"" clive wiggins, a tokyo -based autos analyst for macquarie, said in a recent note to clients . ""we expect earnings to continue beating expectations over the next three years.""last week, toyota agreed to pay more than $1 billion to settle a class-action suit over claims that its electronic malfunctions caused its cars to accelerate without warning, one of the largest payouts ever for an automotive lawsuit. toyota still faces personal injury and wrongful death lawsuits, as well as an unfair business practices case brought by 28 attorneys general in the united states . but the company's.1 billion charge against earnings for the class action was seen as a significant step toward closing the chapter on its recall problems.there have been other signs of change. the company supply chain bounced back more quickly than predicted, profits are on the rise and the yen has started to weaken after the newly installed prime minister, shinzo abe, promised to drive down that currency.and there is a loud message of change being sounded through the stepped-up emphasis on design — with both toyota and lexus models getting new looks, including the pink crown. ""it's actually a beautiful color,"" mr. toyoda said.toyota's rebound has been centered in the united states, where its sales increased.8 percent last year to.88 million vehicles through november. that's more than double the industrywide increase of.9 percent over the same period.the biggest contributors have been stalwart products such as the camry, and the expanded line of prius hybrid models. through november, combined sales of prius cars had risen.3 percent in, as the company continued to dominate the hybrid segment.the company is also betting on a revamped version of a perennial also-ran, the avalon sedan. sales of the current version of the car were down 5 percent last year. the new model, with its wide-mouth grille and sculptured headlamps, reflects the company's efforts to appeal to younger buyers . toyota is trying to shave 10 years off the average age of buyers, now in the mid-60s.the avalon, which was designed and engineered in michigan and is being built at toyota's assembly plant in kentucky, is also a test of how much japanese officials can delegate decision-making to the company's subsidiaries . promoted as toyota's most american vehicle ever, the avalon is the first toyota prototype not developed in japan but at the sprawling toyota technical center near ann arbor, mich., where,100 employees work.",478
business,"consol energy, the largest coal producer in the eastern united states, said on monday that it was selling five highly automated mines — about half of its production capacity — to focus instead on natural gas and on mines that produce coal for export.domestic coal producers are facing stiff challenges. low natural gas prices have made gas -fired electricity cheaper than electricity from coal plants, and ever-stricter air pollution regulations have led to a wave of coal plant retirements. in addition, the environmental protection agency recently proposed limits on carbon emissions for new plants, which could doom conventional coal -fired power .nicholas j. deiuliis, president of the company, which is based in pittsburgh, said in a conference call with reporters that the five mines being sold to the privately held murray energy in the transaction, worth.5 billion to.4 billion, were ""a very profitable business, a very stable business .""but although they historically represent the center of the 150-year-old company's business, they have limited growth potential, he said.""i would not view it as capitulation,"" he said. coal exports continue to grow, he said, and the company will hold onto mines that feed that business, which includes europe, brazil and the pacific rim .consol said it would receive $850 million in cash and $184 million in value from future payments, and murray would take on.4 billion in liabilities, including worker pensions .reflecting the loss of cash flow from the five mines, consol said it would halve its dividend, to 25 cents a share . its stock fell.5 percent in trading on monday.consol is planning to increase its natural gas production by 30 percent a year for the next three years, mr. deiuliis said, and in the next 10 years will invest $14 billion in developing the marcellus shale field in west virginia and nearly $8 billion in the marcellus shale field in pennsylvania, along with.5 billion in pennsylvania coal mines that it is retaining. a major objective of the sale, he said, was to make room in the balance sheet to allow for new investment.the mines being sold are longwall mines, where underground machines spin spike-studded wheels through coal seams, dumping the coal onto conveyor belts that take it to the surface while a handful of human minders monitor the process.",1893
science,"los angeles — a swath of california closed out 2013 as the driest year on record, marked by above-normal temperatures and thirsty reservoirs.while a drought has not been declared, some communities urged residents to conserve water.dozens of cities saw historically parched conditions this year, setting new marks in record-keeping that in some cases dates back more than a century.downtown los angeles received a meager.60 inches of rain since jan. 1, the driest calendar year since. normally, downtown would be soaked with about 15 inches of precipitation.similarly, san francisco recorded just.59 inches of rain since the beginning of the year, 18 inches below normal. sacramento is 14 inches below average after receiving.13 inches of rain this year.the records were not to become official until midnight, but there was not a drop of rain in the forecast for the next several days.""it's been pitiful,"" said bob benjamin, a forecaster for the national weather service in monterey, calif. ""it's a concern, but we do have several months to catch up.""december is typically one of the wettest months, but a stubborn dome of high pressure has steered storms away from california for the past month . while the country shivered during christmas, californians flocked to the beach and basked in summer-like temperatures.the dry spell is not all good news.the lack of rainfall does not bode well for the winter's first snow survey that will be released on friday. real-time readings of the water content in the snowpack — which supplies much of california's water — reveal it's only 20 percent of normal.many of the state's major reservoirs are below average for the month.shasta lake, the state's largest reservoir, is currently at 37 percent of its total capacity . folsom lake recently dipped below 20 percent of its capacity, marking a historic low for the month. this triggered some communities in the sacramento - san joaquin delta region to issue water conservation orders.the northern california city of folsom recently mandated that residents cut water consumption by 20 percent. sacramento county asked unincorporated areas to voluntarily reduce water use by the same amount. state water managers are also discussing transferring water from places with relative abundance to communities facing critical shortages.even before the state was gripped by record dryness, several cities, including santa monica and long beach in southern california, have planned to reduce their dependence on imported water in the coming years by maximizing groundwater supplies, harvesting stormwater and increasing recycled water distribution .despite an arid year, forecasters said the rainy season is not over yet. in past years, a dry december gave way to storms in january.""or we can get a miracle march that bails us out a little bit,"" said state climatologist michael anderson.",371
sports,"boston — with the pain and tightness gone from his strained quadriceps muscle, derek jeter was hoping the yankees would let him avoid the disabled list on friday and play in only his second game of the season.but the yankees, aware of how eager jeter is to play, were concerned that he might not be as accurate about the state of his leg as a highly sensitive magnetic resonance imaging test can be. so, to prove that he could play, jeter first had to prove it in an m.r.i. tube.and unfortunately for him and the yankees, the test revealed only minimal healing in his right quad, general manager brian cashman said friday at fenway park . jeter was placed on the 15-day disabled list retroactive to july.""i don't think they trust me too much anymore,"" jeter said, ""so they put me in the m.r.i. machine again, and like i've told you before, i can't fake out the tests. i had to take that m.r.i. to prove i was ready, and i wasn't.""as the yankees came out of the all-star break, jeter, their captain and shortstop, has still played only one game all season. the earliest he can play now is july. the yankees called up infielder brent lillibridge to take his spot on the 25- man roster . jeter is not only coming off the worst injury of his career, but he is also trying to do it at. he rejected any suggestion that his age had been a factor in either the injuries or the recovery process.""my ankle broke,"" he said. ""people break ankles at different ages. i don't think you reach a certain age and your ankles start breaking. i've injured a quad before when i was younger, i pulled a hamstring when i was in my 20s, so i don't think that age has anything to do with it.""but in the midst of what he called an odd season, frustration has seeped in. after spending nearly nine months recovering from a twice-broken left ankle, jeter finally returned on july, only to injure his quad while running out a ground ball in his third at-bat. he said that in recent days the tightness and pain had dissipated, which initially gave hope to him and his teammates.""we have our captain, and the first day he comes back, he goes down the same day,"" mariano rivera said. ""it's like when you're a teacher and you give a kid a toy, and in the afternoon, you take it back."" jeter, although a little grumpy and obviously frustrated that he would have to sit out two series — against the boston red sox over the weekend and the texas rangers next week — said he saw no reason he would not be ready to play a week from saturday. cashman was not so certain.""i can't tell you that,"" he said. ""i wish i could say yes. i think he would say yes, but i can't say yes."" cashman was far more definitive about alex rodriguez's return from january hip surgery . despite all the uncertainty surrounding rodriguez's return, including the possibility of a suspension because of an inquiry into his involvement with an anti-aging clinic that has been accused of dispensing performance enhancing drugs, cashman said he expected rodriguez to join the team in texas on monday and play that night or the next.""we fully expect to have him activated, as of now, on monday,"" cashman said, adding that rodriguez would play third base unless he was exhausted. cashman also noted that curtis granderson, who is recovering from a broken left hand, should start his minor league rehab assignment in a week to 10 days. he was hopeful that granderson could return to the regular lineup in the first week of august, if all goes well.if rodriguez is not deemed ready to play, he will remain on the disabled list and will not be able to play in any more minor league games . rodriguez hit his second home run during his 11th game in his minor league rehabilitation assignment on thursday for class aaa scranton/wilkes-barre . after that game, he was batting only.188 (6 for 32) and had not looked very flexible or mobile . but cashman said he still felt that rodriguez would be an upgrade over the seven others who have played third base this year: david adams, luis cruz, alberto gonzalez, chris nelson, jayson nix, kevin youkilis and lillibridge, who started there friday.""he's better than the production we've gotten so far at third base this year,"" cashman said of rodriguez, ""with all due respect to everybody else.""the yankees have also used five starting shortstops. that does not include jeter, who was the designated hitter in his only game.""it's been a strange nine months in general,"" jeter said.
