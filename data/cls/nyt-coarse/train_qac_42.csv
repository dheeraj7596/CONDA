 context : it took a powerful, disturbing dream from which she awoke sobbing to convince robin charboneau, an oglala sioux and member of north dakota's spirit lake tribe, that ""i needed to open my mouth, and i needed to speak."" so she let the documentary filmmaker david sutherland follow her for more than three years as she struggled to raise her family as a single mother while confronting her alcoholism and the scars of being sexually abused as a child.what she did not know was that her decision would temporarily cost her custody of her two children in tribal court, or that her teenage daughter would disclose that she too had been sexually abused — by her own father, a development that led to a federal trial and, for the filmmaker and the producers, ethical soul searching .ms. charboneau's story and that of her children — darian, now, and anthony, 14 — unspool in mr. sutherland's ""kind hearted woman,"" a five-hour presentation on the pbs series ""frontline"" and ""independent lens"" on april 1 and. like mr. sutherland's 1998 film ""the farmer's wife,"" chronicling the challenges of a nebraska farm couple, and the 2006 ""country boys,"" which follows two high school students in appalachia, ""kind hearted woman"" is a detailed portrait of the kind of lives rarely given a media spotlight, those lived on the margins of rural america, where money and education are scarce.mr. sutherland, 67, set out to deal with the subject of abuse, he said in an interview in his boston sound-mixing studio. but he too stumbled into a much more complex story than the small-scale human drama he anticipated. now, two years after he finished filming, his work can be seen as something of an exhibit a in explaining why the federal bureau of indian affairs took control of social services on the spirit lake indian reservation last year, citing concerns that tribal mismanagement had led to abuse of children there.the film almost didn't get made. after ""country boys"" mr. sutherland took a break from filmmaking until receiving fan mail from patricia harrison, the chief executive of the corporation for public broadcasting, which administers federal funds for public broadcasting . he said it spurred him back to his cameras and microphones, which capture the extraordinarily rich sound that distinguishes his work. (the corporation later supported the film with a substantial grant.)during his initial hunt for a subject, mr. sutherland said, he had no plans to focus on american indians, but his research led him to ms. charboneau, now.as a ""portraitist,"" he said, ""all i'm going for is to put a face on a family that happens to be native. i want you to feel like you're in their skin."" ms. charboneau said in a phone interview that at the time mr. sutherland was only the third person she had told about her sexual abuse .he initially believed the film, which began shooting in, would focus on ms. charboneau's efforts to get sober and continue her education . but raney aronson-rath, the deputy executive producer of ""frontline,"" said that the news ""caught up with david"" after the editing started in. early on, she said, even though the filmmakers felt there was a bigger story to be told about the tribal court system — shown through ms. charboneau's interactions with it — ""we didn't understand the systemic nature of what was going on at spirit lake"" until the federal takeover late last summer. the documentary does not refer to that intervention because mr. sutherland's portrait was already complete.often, ms. aronson-rath said, the opposite chain of events happens with documentaries : a wider news event or scandal breaks, and producers scramble to find a character to put an empathetic face on the broader story. but whenever the news does catch up to a documentary as it is being made, ""it's because we're on the right issues,"" said michael sullivan, a former executive producer of special projects at ""frontline,"" who oversaw mr. sutherland's films until leaving the program in february. in this case, separate from the documentary, ""frontline"" assigned a reporter, sarah childress, to cover the intervention for the show's web site .more problematic for the filmmakers was that early on in the filming darian made a wrenching charge: her father, anthony charboneau iii, had sexually abused her.as a filmmaker, said lois vossen, the series producer of ""independent lens,"" ""your natural instinct is to want to use that."" at the same time ""you want to help somebody, not put them in harm's way.""when editing got under way, ms. aronson-rath said, ""we had a really robust editorial discussion around both darian and also her brother. we thought long and hard about it. we listened to david sutherland for days and days and days about his decision making and the level of access that he had and the trust that he had built between them. and we were convinced that there was a real trust there, that robin was acting on behalf of her children in a way that was responsible, from what we could tell.""eventually, darian's revelation became the film's centerpiece, along with her father's subsequent trial and conviction.mr. sutherland, in an exception to normal ""frontline"" rules, shows his finished films to his subjects in advance; darian could have objected then, the producers noted. ""darian is always fairly direct,"" mr. sutherland said.as a minor darian had the right to withhold consent for the use of the abuse material, mr. sullivan of frontline said, adding, ""we were always gambling a bit that the footage would remain in the film .""in a telephone interview darian said she at first embraced the filming, which started when she was. ""i thought it was pretty cool because i thought we were going to be famous,"" she said. but as she got older, ""it started to dawn on me what it was really going to be like, that my personal life was going to be shown out there more. i was more scared what people would think of me, if i would lose people because of it."" for several months she forbade mr. sutherland to film her. in the end ""i'm all right with it,"" she said. ""i don't regret my story being out there. i am hoping it could help girls my age.""still, the producers have gone to pains to prepare the family for the consequences of a national broadcast. when ""the farmer's wife"" was shown, it drew donations of everything from carpeting for that family's house to a trip to disney world to braces for the title character . ""you suddenly go from being a private person to a public person,"" ms. vossen said.ms. charboneau seems to have already made that leap. she has written a statement to other abuse victims and will participate in outreach efforts connected to the film . once she committed to mr. sutherland's documentary, she decided, ""whatever happens in the process of filming, if it helps that one woman — if it helps her get out — then it's worth it,"" she said. ""it's worth whatever i have to give.""

 context : in a sign of the growing mainstream acceptance of products derived from algae, unilever, the consumer products giant, has agreed to buy large amounts of oil from solazyme, a start-up that bioengineers algae to produce oils, proteins and complex sugars, executives said tuesday.unilever said it would use the oil for its personal care products, which include dove and brylcreem. the agreement, under which unilever plans to buy roughly three million gallons of the algae-produced oil over 12 to 18 months starting early next year, is part of its aim to double the size of its business while reducing its overall environmental footprint. toward that end, unilever has said it will use only sustainable agricultural raw materials by, a goal it met last year in its purchases of palm oil from sustainable sources.for solazyme, the agreement represents an important step as it ramps up to commercial-scale production. originally conceived as a fuel business, solazyme has focused on making oils for products with higher profit margins like personal care, food and petrochemicals .the unilever oil, developed in a five-year partnership with solazyme, will be made at a plant it built in brazil with bunge, a leading agribusiness and food company . when fully operational, the plant could produce roughly 30 million gallons of oil a year.""this is the first oil that was jointly developed that's going to a product sale,"" said jonathan s. wolfson, solazyme's chief executive . ""we've laid out the path for years, and now we're closing the first big loop about where a big chunk of this oil goes coming out of one of these plants.""solazyme, based in south san francisco, calif., has developed several strains of microalgae that can produce oils, proteins and complex sugars with specific characteristics to perform a variety of functions. though it still plans to mass-market fuel, it has entered into partnerships with established companies to help it increase manufacturing capacity for its several product lines.

 context : jefferson city, mo. — looking for the new health insurance marketplace, set to open in this state in two months, is like searching for a unicorn.the marketplace, or exchange, being established by the federal government under president obama's health care law has no visible presence here, no local office, no official voice in the state and no board of local advisers. it is being run like a covert operation, with no marketing or detailed information about its products or their prices.while states like colorado, connecticut and california race to offer subsidized insurance to their citizens, missouri stands out among the states that have put up significant obstacles. it has refused to create an insurance exchange, leaving the job to the federal government . it has forbidden state and local government officials to cooperate with the federal exchange .it has required insurance counselors to get state licenses before they can help consumers navigate the new insurance market . and, like many states, it has refused to expand medicaid .""it's like running an obstacle course every day of the week, but the course changes from day to day,"" said herb b. kuhn, president of the missouri hospital association, a strong advocate of expanded coverage . state senator rob schaaf, the republican author of a 2012 ballot measure that prevented the state from setting up its own insurance exchange, said: ""we can't afford everything we do now, let alone provide free medical care to able-bodied adults. i have a philosophical problem with doing that, and i'm also worried about our country's financial situation .""over,000 missouri residents, including low-income people in st . louis and kansas city, family farmers and small-business employees, are uninsured. many could qualify for coverage through the exchange, which encourages competition and offers subsidies to reduce costs .kenneth l. schmidt, an insurance broker in st . louis who intends to sell insurance products offered on the exchange, said: ""we have not seen any evidence of the federal exchange — how it will be run, how it will be structured in missouri . will it be run from jefferson city ? will it be run from washington ? who will watch over it? no clue.""david r. griggs, who owns a carpet store with 15 employees in columbia, mo., said he was hungry for information about the exchange . but, he said, ""i have not seen or heard a word about it.""kat cunningham of columbia, the president of moresource, a firm that handles payroll and benefits for more than 600 employers, said she had been deluged with questions from clients and was struggling to provide guidance.she said her clients wanted to know: ""where do we go to purchase health care coverage ? how much will it cost us? if we can't afford it, what then?""private foundations and community groups have stepped into the vacuum. m. ryan barker, vice president of the missouri foundation for health, said his organization planned to spend $8 million this year on a campaign to secure coverage for,000 of the uninsured. ""the state government is not doing a whole lot, its hands are tied, so we are taking on a bigger role,"" he said.jennifer g. bersdale, executive director of missouri health care for all, a grass-roots organization, has been educating thousands of people about what she sees as an exhilarating prospect. ""people who have been shut out of the market for years will soon be able to get good insurance, cannot be denied because of pre-existing conditions and can get financial assistance to afford it,"" she said. missouri is one of a handful of states where the federal government directly enforces the consumer protections of the affordable care act because the state lacks the authority to do so. in, missouri voters overwhelmingly approved a ballot measure expressing opposition to the federal requirement for most americans to have health insurance .in november, voters approved a ballot measure that prohibits the governor and other state officials from establishing or operating a state -based insurance exchange unless authorized by a vote of the people or by the state legislature . the measure says state and local officials cannot provide ""assistance or resources of any kind"" to a federal exchange unless such assistance is specifically required by federal law . it authorizes taxpayers and state legislators to sue state and local officials who flout its restrictions. the threat of lawsuits has made local officials cautious. gov . jay nixon, a democrat, said debate on the ballot measures had been highly political. he has held dozens of events to promote the expansion of medicaid, stressing its economic benefits for the state . but republicans hold two-thirds of the seats in each house of the legislature .""a core principle of public health is to increase access to health care,"" said josephine p. waltman, the health officer for phelps county. but, she said, the ballot measure limits what local officials can do and is forcing them to consult lawyers .as a result, ms. waltman said she and her staff would distribute general information about the insurance exchange, but would not sit down with people at computers to help them choose health plans and see if they qualify for subsidies . ""i would love to do that,"" she said.

 context : st . louis — with the cardinals down, 4-2, and with two outs in the bottom of the ninth inning sunday, carlos beltran, a hitting star who represented the tying run, came to bat. the way st . louis won the night before, he would surely hit the next pitch to the outfield seats.kolten wong, a rookie who was pinch-running, took a lead at first base. and koji uehera, the boston red sox closer, toed the mound, spying wong out of the corner of his eye.in one swift motion, uehara spun and fired to first base. wong turned to get back, but his back foot slipped, and he was caught. uehara ran and gave mike napoli, the first baseman, a jumping, two-handed high-five in celebration. for the second straight night, the game had ended in bizarre fashion. this time the red sox won, 4-2, evening the world series at two games apiece. game 5 will be here monday night .wong was near tears afterward. ""i knew i was dead once it happened, once i went to plant and push and felt nothing go,"" he said. ""my foot just slipped out.""beltran said, ""i feel bad for the kid.""but there, of course, had been many other chances before that. lance lynn, the cardinals' starter, had cruised through the first four innings, allowing one hit, an infield single to david ortiz, yet the cardinals led only, 1-0. clay buchholz, who was dealing with stiffness in his pitching shoulder, had somehow held them.buchholz had missed three months during the season with a shoulder injury, and had been struggling in the playoffs. in three starts, he had posted a.40 earned run average and had not pitched past the sixth inning . his manager, john farrell, pushed his next start back to game, meaning he would have to pitch only one game in this world series .he made it count. though his fastball was sitting at about 88 miles per hour, he went four innings and allowed three hits and only one unearned run . after he exited, boston tied the score in the fifth inning, on a bases-loaded sacrifice fly by stephen drew .the game was shaping up to be another tight one, to be decided late, just like the night before. game 3 had ended in a chaotic mess, both teams pouring onto the field. not everyone knew exactly what had just happened.in the bottom of the ninth, with yadier molina on third and allen craig on second, with the red sox' infield drawn in and with one out, jon jay hit a grounder to dustin pedroia . he fired home to get molina. then jarrod saltalamacchia made a wild throw to third.will middlebrooks, the third baseman, tripped trying to catch the throw and fell onto his stomach. as the ball squirted away, craig took off for home and got tangled in middlebrooks's legs. the ball eventually beat craig home, but he was ruled safe.jim joyce, the third- base umpire, had called middlebrooks for obstruction. the red sox were stunned. many of them later complained about the call to the news media .farrell then had to explain several questionable decisions he had made. he had allowed brandon workman, the pitcher, to bat in the ninth with the score tied. he had not used mike napoli, his best weapon off the bench. and he had not called to walk jay in that spot, which would have brought up pete kozma, a lesser threat.farrell said sunday he had not slept well that night. but he was confident in his team's leaders, he said, that they would put game 3 behind them.""we can't go back to yesterday,"" farrell said.the red sox seemed to understand there was less room to spare now. before the sixth inning, with the score tied at, ortiz gave a speech to his teammates in the dugout, reminding them how rare this opportunity was, urging them to play free and loose.""it was like 24 kindergartners looking up at their teacher,"" jonny gomes said.that inning, they rallied. dustin pedroia hit a two-out single, and ortiz drew a four-pitch walk, which chased lynn from the game. on came seth maness, the reliever, and in stepped gomes, who was a late addition to the lineup. only after shane victorino had been scratched with tightness in his lower back was he inserted.on a count of, gomes muscled a sinker well over the wall in left field. he rounded first base, his right arm raised high. then he pounded the "" boston "" across his chest and let out a tribal, cathartic scream, as if he wanted all of st . louis to hear him.farrell, too, seemed more aggressive, mixing his relievers.when felix doubront and craig breslow ran into trouble, allowing a run to score in the seventh inning, farrell brought in junichi tazawa to shut the door . then he had john lackey, his game 2 starter, pitch the eighth inning, and uehara the ninth.craig came on to pinch-hit again, just as he had the previous night, and singled to right field. wong pinch-ran for him, which led to another strange ending.but there was no controversy, no debate, no doubt about it this time, like the ball jumping off gomes's bat. the red sox had won on their own talent and volition.

 context : tracy letts knows his play ""august: osage county "" is a winner. a scathingly funny tale of a broken oklahoma family, ""august"" won the tony award, the pulitzer and almost every other accolade for best play after it opened on broadway in.""it's battle tested,"" mr. letts said in an interview. ""it's been put through its paces. so there's no question about the material.""but how will a darkly comic story about mostly ornery people, including violet and her three daughters, that is set inside a sprawling old house on the plains, work on film ? mr. letts will find out when his screen adaptation, starring meryl streep, julia roberts and other well-known names who weren't in the stage version, opens in theaters on dec. 27.""i know that there's another dimension in the film that is not in the play, and that's osage county,"" he said. the stage production couldn't show what was beyond the walls of the set, and audiences in new york probably wouldn't know the terrain. but with a film, ""to take them to my home and show them the landscape, that's kind of profound for me as a guy who not only has written a play, but written a play that's somewhat autobiographical. the landscape itself becomes a character.""the road from proscenium to screen is tricky for playwrights. a film that looks too much like a play can be lifeless and visually one dimensional. give a director too much power without putting up a fight, and it's no longer your story. (if you're in it for the hollywood money, then who cares?)erik piepenburg recently spoke with playwrights about lessons they learned when their works got the big-screen treatment. following are excerpts from their phone interviews and emails. more responses are at nytimes.com/theater.i was very lucky because i had a director, bruce beresford, who had directed several plays turned into movies . he said: let me see your draft. then he said: you've retyped your play. he told me: you don't need to talk as much in the movies . you don't need to say, ""i'll go get the car."" just show it. he said: instead of dialogue, just give me a description of the way you remember things looked. some of it was the way the sunlight came through blinds, or reader's digests stacked up on the radiator, or doing the silver polish with an old toothbrush — things i remember. i would say: just tell the truth. and don't say it so many times.i did ""doubt"" as a film, a play and an opera. we were there to use the new materials we'd been offered to express the story in the way it wants to be expressed. i realized that if the priest is giving a sermon, we're going to see the congregation. the movie came to life as a filmic idea rather than a theater idea. it's not an obvious thing to be able to get people to go to a movie where they buy popcorn to watch nuns and priests argue. i was scared.get the best director you can who really shares your viewpoint, and really fight hard for the actors you want. with ""the ritz,"" i had some enticing offers to do it with some stars and more famous directors, but i never have regretted that decision to keep most of the original broadway cast . what i liked most about my first two movies is that they preserved great performances. if you care about the final result, sometimes you have to be prepared to walk away from a deal.what i didn't know before the screenplay of ""a soldier's story"" was that writing for films is like riding in a bus where every traveler (justifiably) has a say in where the bus ( movie ) is going. writing plays is like riding a motorcycle — you are in charge of where the play goes — and while you may have someone enjoying the trip with you, (a producer or director) motorcycles can only hold a few riders.there are no words in the climax of the movie, and in the play there are only words. the sister character in the play is a source of comic relief, which is helpful in a play about the death of a child. but her part in film was cut away, and that concerned me. not until i saw the film with an audience did i realize there's all this new stuff that got laughs that i didn't know was there. when i sat in a broadway house, i knew where all the laughs were.

 context : manu daftary, manager of the quaker strategic growth fund, says he learned a valuable lesson in. he avoided companies like the american international group, bank of america and citgroup, which, to one degree or another, were damaged by the subprime mortgage crisis and benefited from the help of the federal reserve . his portfolio's performance suffered, though, as he minimized investments in such companies .""i kicked myself every day,"" he says.mr. daftary made a vow: never again would he ignore the fed and the companies that seem to profit most from its market interventions.that lesson appears to have served him well this year. his portfolio, laced with what were relatively out-of-favor companies, has thrived in a period of rock-bottom interest rates — climbing nearly 16 percent through june.more broadly, the market has richly rewarded investors in many companies with weak balance sheets — those that have relatively high debt loads. the fed's policy of low interest rates has enabled such companies to refinance their debt more cheaply, often driving up their share prices . goldman sachs has found that stocks with weak balance sheets performed far better than those with strong balance sheets in the first half this year. goldman tracks a marketbasket of 50 strong- balance-sheet stocks . it was up just 9 percent through june, far behind the.4 percent gain for a portfolio with the same number of weak- balance-sheet shares.mr. daftary owns a number of the stocks in the weak- balance-sheet basket. these include anadarko petroleum, time warner and cbs, all strong performers this year.the goldman market basket doesn't include financial stocks . but the quaker fund's portfolio does: it holds a.i.g., a company that has ""absolutely"" benefited from fed purchases of mortgage-backed securities, mr. daftary said.don hodges, who with his son craig manages the hodges fund, also emphasizes out-of-favor stocks . ""the interest-rate environment is definitely a positive,"" he said. across all industries, he added, "" companies are paying down debt .""this is especially helpful to many companies whose share prices plunged as a result of the financial crisis . ""when everything gets trashed, stocks at the bottom of the pit get doubly trashed,"" mr. hodges said. he has done well with a. h. belo, the newspaper chain, and luby's, the restaurant company . investors have recently fretted over the prospect of cutbacks later this year in the fed's bond-buying program. still, officials at the fed have emphasized that its policy of near-zero short-term interest rates will not end soon. low rates and strong investor demand for yield, meanwhile, have set a picnic table for some companies looking to raise cash and refinance debt at lower cost . last year, there were 192 offerings of bb debt — at the top end of speculative-grade ratings — that raised.2 billion, according to standard & poor's . that was up from 126 companies and.5 billion in. this year, the pace of bb borrowing has accelerated further.about half of the total $652 billion in speculative-grade bond and leveraged loan issuance in 2011 and 2012 has gone toward refinancing debt, typically at lower rates, according to s.& p.apart from the benefits of fed policies, stocks of companies with relatively weak financials have outperformed for another reason: many had become very cheap.in the aftermath of the financial crisis, stocks perceived as high risk were shunned, said bill miller, who manages the legg mason opportunity trust. ""anything which had high perceived risk would tend to be radically mispriced,"" mr. miller said. the legg mason fund owns housing stocks like kb home and pulte, along with the mortgage insurers mgic investment and genworth financial, which declined sharply during the crisis . all have thrived lately.fed policies like quantitative easing — direct purchases of bonds and other securities — have helped stock prices even as earnings growth has slowed, noted richard bernstein, chief executive of richard bernstein advisors. the positive effects of quantitative easing ""and the accompanying lower interest rates have been more powerful than has been the slowdown in earnings growth,"" he wrote in early june.here's one example of how fed policies have helped a company : mgic, the mortgage insurer, suffered years of financial loses after the housing bubble burst . share prices bottomed last august at less than $1 a share. but with fed policies easing credit access while helping to lift both housing and equity markets, mgic was able to raise more than $1 billion in march in convertible and secondary stock offeringsamong the funds with the largest holdings in goldman's weak- balance-sheet basket is dfa tax -managed u.s. marketwide value. jed fogdall is a manager of the fund, which has sizable holdings in anadarko, kraft foods, thermo fisher scientific and time warner, all big winners in the first half this year.the fund isn't necessarily looking for weak- balance-sheet stocks — just cheap ones. it focuses on the 20 percent of russell 1000 value stocks that have the highest ratios of book-to- market value. ""we hold these stocks because they have a higher expected rate of return,"" mr. fogdall explained.if the fed ends its stimulative monetary policy, stocks with weaker balance sheets could be hit hard, of course. while this is a risk, mr. hodges doesn't foresee an early end to the fed's low-interest-rate policies .some fund managers, however, are not convinced that weak- balance-sheet stocks will continue to outperform.jeff constantino, manager of the mfs massachusetts investors growth stock fund, acknowledged the advantages that leveraged companies have had under fed policies. ""they can roll over debt if they need to,"" he said. ""and they can refinance at lower rates .""but he says he thinks their run may be nearing an end. ""it's possible that a lot of the outperformance of highly leveraged companies is behind us,"" he said. he's especially cautious about leveraged companies that also have cyclical characteristics.he cited the example of industrial supply companies, also known as industrial distributors. ""in the financial crisis, a lot of smaller industrial distributors weren't able to invest in inventory,"" he said. ""the financing was so tight and they didn't have the free cash flow ."" that provided an opportunity for a better-heeled company, w. w. grainger, which the mfs portfolio holds. ""grainger invested aggressively during the downturn,"" he said. ""they took substantial market share .""mr. constantino isn't fighting the fed. but he says he is trying to stick with quality. ""even if we remain in a low- growth world with low interest rates, i still prefer to invest in high-quality companies with pricing power and significant cash flow that can be allocated to create value,"" he said.

 context : jersey city, n.j. — matt kuchar and gary woodland began their week at the barclays by going to citi field and getting a tour of the clubhouse, where kuchar noticed an indoor batting cage and asked if they could try it out. he stood behind the net and threw to woodland, a promising baseball player in high school .""gary hit and was really impressive,"" kuchar said. ""i didn't hit and didn't show anything differently, but gary was impressive swinging a baseball bat.""woodland isn't too bad with a golf club in his hands, either.playing with kuchar in the final group, woodland ran off four straight birdies saturday afternoon with another powerful display of his athleticism and shot a 3-under, giving him a share of the lead with kuchar going into the final round at liberty national .""man, that guy can play some golf,"" kuchar said, knowing that woodland was within earshot. kuchar, who played bogey-free on the back nine in blustery conditions for a, remains more polished. he already has two wins this year, at the match play championship and memorial, and he is a past champion at the barclays .for much of the day they were trading birdies — along with a few bad breaks — and wound up tied at 12-under.kuchar's from off the green on the reachable par-4 16th was stopped by a sprinkler, while woodland putted his to close range for birdie. woodland gave back the stroke on the next hole with a drive that plugged into the far end of the bunker, forcing him to blast it out sideways and costing him a bogey.they are close friends and former world cup partners.but the final round at liberty national doesn't belong to only them. kevin chappell broke the tournament course record with a 62 — 10 shots better than the average score on saturday — and was one shot behind.""in the wind, if you would have told me someone was going to shoot 62 today, i would probably have laughed at you,"" chappell said.and very much in the mix was tiger woods, bad back and all. woods was just hanging around for so much of the day, gingerly bending over to put his ball on a tee and retrieve it out of the cup. his fortunes turned with two strong shots on the par-5 13th led to birdie, he drove the 16th green for another birdie and finished with a 10- foot birdie putt and a. woods was four shots behind, along with david lynn, who also had a.""it starts off great every day, and then it progressively deteriorates as the day goes on,"" woods said of his lower back, which he hurt from what he said was a soft bed in his hotel room . ""hopefully, tomorrow it will be one of those days again. fight through it and see if i can win a tournament.""the large group at 7-under 206 included 20-year-old jordan spieth, bubba watson, jim furyk, justin rose and rickie fowler .chappell's round was evidence that even in windy conditions, low scores are available. for the former ucla bruin, it was really was simple as making putts, most of them in that 10-foot to 15-foot range. there were a few par saves on the back nine, and six birdies on the front.""i just really holed all the putts that you kind of expect to hold but you don't always hole,"" he said. kuchar and woodland will be in the final group for the second straight day, and they certainly aren't strangers. kuchar represented the americans in the world cup two years ago in china . after scouting the mission hills course and seeing it was long, he picked woodland as his partner. the americans wound up winning their first world cup title in over a decade.woodland is regarded as one of the best athletes on tour — a promising baseball player in high school who first went to a division ii school to play basketball and then transferred to kansas to play golf .but he has disappeared since winning at innisbrook two years ago, mainly from injuries to both wrists. he began working with claude harmon iii in the spring, and he hired mental coach julie elion right before his season turned around by winning the reno-tahoe open earlier this month .""i've really let my game take over,"" woodland said.he surged into the lead during a four- hole stretch to close out the back nine — a 5-iron into the par-5 sixth, a sand wedge to 10 feet for birdie on no. 7, a 4-wood for his second shot on the par-5 eighth for birdie, and a 6-iron for a fourth straight birdie on the ninth. even on the 16th hole, which played 289 yards, woodland has so much power than he went with a 2-iron and came up just short. kuchar caught up by playing bogey-free on the back nine with three birdies, starting with a superb shot on the 10th to 3 feet.divots: rory mcilroy had an even-par 71 and was six shots out of the lead. ... aaron baddeley shot, and at no. 119 in the fedex cup standings, stands a good chance of being among the top 100 players to advance to the second playoff event next week outside boston . ...greg chalmers made a hole-in-one on the 135-yard 14th, with the statue of liberty in view to the right. in the next group, k.j. choi almost made an ace . ... lynn was squatting to read the line of his putt on the 10th green when he toppled backward and landed on his seat. looking over, he made a motion that he had been drinking, and the gallery ate it up. ... chappell has gone 25 consecutive holes without a bogey.

 context : in, with the american economy booming, the proportion of workers who were laid off or discharged over a 12-month period fell to.5 percent. that was the lowest rate since the government began collecting the data at the end of 2000 — and a sign that the job market was exceedingly strong.but the rate of firings soared during the credit crisis and great recession, hitting a peak of.4 percent in late.now it has fallen to the lowest level ever recorded.8 percent.in other words, a worker's chance of being fired is now less than it was when the job market was booming, and much less than it was when the economy was in trouble four years ago .and yet, the job situation now is not a good one. while fewer people are being fired, the rate of hiring has barely picked up. and as can be seen in the accompanying charts, the long-term unemployment rate — the proportion of the labor force that has been out of work for more than 15 weeks — remains higher than the short-term rate. in october, the long-term rate was.8 percent, while the short-term rate was just.5 percent.from, when the bureau of labor statistics began to publish monthly unemployment rates based on a survey of households, until mid, the long-term rate was never as high as the short-term rate. since then, it has consistently been higher, although the gap has narrowed.what seems to have happened in the united states is that job mobility — historically an important feature of the nation's labor market — fell rapidly during the recession and has yet to recover much.the data on hirings and firings is compiled by the government in its monthly jolts — job openings and labor turnover survey — report. the charts on hirings and firings, as well as on voluntary departures, are based on actual numbers over 12-month periods, not on the seasonally adjusted figures.by adding the monthly figures, the charts may overstate job mobility to some extent. in some cases, the same worker may have been hired several times during a year, and have left just as many jobs during the same period. that is particularly true in industries like construction, where many jobs are for relatively brief periods.but even taking that into account, the fact remains that in a normal year the number of workers leaving jobs — whether voluntarily or involuntarily — amounts to more than 40 percent of the total number of jobs . the number of new hires is, of course, at a slightly higher rate if employment is rising.in good times, most of that job mobility represents the choice of workers, as more people leave their jobs by choice than because they were laid off or fired. some of those retired, but most quit, either because they had found a better job or because they expected to find one. but during the recession, the number of people leaving voluntarily plunged, and for the first time since the data was collected, the number of people losing their jobs because they were fired in 2009 exceeded the number who left voluntarily.one measure of the health of the job market is the number of unemployed people for each unfilled job vacancy. at the end of, when the data was first collected, that figure was just over one — an indication of the boom that ended with the 2001 recession . it soared to nearly seven to one during the recession . the latest figures show the ratio has fallen back to.9. by that measure, the job market is finally a little better than it was at the low point early in the last decade.but it appears that many of the people who have been unemployed the longest simply lack the skills to get the available jobs . the short-term unemployment rate is back to the levels that prevailed for most of the period before the recession . but the long-term rate, while it is falling, remains higher than it was at any time before the recession .

""today really was almost the culmination of all that.""over the past two and a half years, spaceshiptwo has made a series of tests as a glider. on monday morning, with mr. branson among the spectators, a carrier aircraft lofted spaceshiptwo to a height of,000 feet before letting it go. this time, it did more than glide.the engine roared for 16 seconds, accelerating spaceshiptwo to mach.2 – 1.2 times the speed of sound – and pushing it to an altitude of,000 feet, about.5 miles. ""you can see very, very clearly the plume of flames coming out the back of the spaceship,"" mr. branson said. ""you can see it speeding up through the sky.""with the engine off, it then glided to landing about 10 minutes later.""before it's lit, there's natural nervousness,"" said mr. branson, who stood next to mr. rutan during the test flight. ""once it was lit, it was a moment of relief, but also actually joy for every single person standing there.""more test flights will follow as spaceshiptwo goes faster and higher before the start of commercial operations, which will be launched from spaceport america outside las cruces, n.m. virgin galactic currently has 560 ticket holders .

 context : spring for music — the annual festival of north american orchestras at carnegie hall, created in the main to foster imaginative and ambitious programming — did itself proud over the weekend in the last three concerts of its third season. leonard slatkin conducted the detroit symphony orchestra on thursday and friday, and christoph eschenbach led the national symphony orchestra on saturday.as expected, the high point came on friday evening with detroit's audacious presentation of an ""ives immersion: all four of charles ives's numbered symphonies in chronological order. obvious in retrospect (though not likely to be repeated often, given its strenuous demands on performers and listeners alike, the program made for an extraordinary journey, from the relatively conventional sensibility of a prodigious student composer in the first symphony to the unfettered one of an indomitable master in the fourth.in remarks from the stage, vivian perlis, a historian of american music, rightly pointed to a dvorakian character in the first symphony, begun in; indeed, the english horn solo in the adagio molto clearly takes its cue from the largo of dvorak's ""new world"" symphony. thereafter, ives became strictly his own man, however widely he may have drawn from musical americana.taken together, the four symphonies could almost be read as individual movements of a gigantic whole, so natural and compelling was the flow. after that first symphony — first movement, as it were — the second came as a sort of scherzo, gamboling through old folk and hymn tunes, with ""columbia, the gem of the ocean"" as anchor. the third symphony, relatively restrained and more focused in its borrowing, seemed a calming slow movement before the all-out radicalization of the fourth.mr. slatkin preceded his performance of the fourth symphony with a brief, brilliant demonstration of the work's complexities.he had the orchestra play a four-measure mashup of tunes and rhythms from the second movement, then had the various sections play individual layers. and what should appear but "" turkey in the straw"" in the violins, scarcely to be heard behind the blaring trumpets and under the accumulated weight of other instruments when everything was put back together. in similar fashion, mr. slatkin showed why a second conductor (teddy abrams) was needed in parts of the second and fourth movements, dismantling, then remantling the conflicting meters.mr. slatkin, who became music director of the detroit symphony in, said before the festival that he was eager to show ""how far the orchestra has come in a very short time,"" since its six-month strike in the 2010-11 season. it performed nobly through the long haul of the ives, and it had been given another chance to strut its stuff in the festival when the oregon symphony, unable to cover the costs of travel and lodging, had to cancel its appearance. detroit, on thursday night, adopted half of the whopper of a program for which oregon had been selected: ""the seven deadly sins"" of kurt weill and bertolt brecht, with the soprano storm large, and ""la valse"" by ravel. but mr. slatkin, hewing to a theme of colorful works by composers trying to come to grips with the 20th century, replaced the rest of the program (narong prangcharoen's ""phenomenon,"" schoenberg's ""accompaniment to a film scene"" and schubert's ""unfinished"" symphony) with pieces by rachmaninoff, whose music he and the orchestra are now recording for naxos: the ""capriccio bohémien"" and ""isle of the dead.""""isle of the dead"" ranks — with mendelssohn's concert overture ""the hebrides"" and britten's ""four sea interludes"" from the opera ""peter grimes"" — among the great sea pieces, and mr. slatkin's atmospheric reading was especially evocative of surging waves. the death angle enters with variants on the dies irae tune from the roman catholic requiem, which fascinated rachmaninoff through much of his career.the orchestra shone throughout, but with ""the seven deadly sins,"" detroit inherited that show stealer ms. large, who is best known for her popsier work with pink martini and other bands. she was sensational in a brecht-weill experiment of dipping country innocence serially into urban decadence and seeing what comes out. what came out here was personality plus (the tattoo across ms. large's back, for those who couldn't make it out, read, ""lover, and her voice came through the subtle miking fetchingly. the other singers — jorge garza, carl moe, anton belov and richard zeller — injected character of their own, but though they were also miked, many of their words were lost in a jumble; printed texts would have helped.the national symphony program on saturday, ""a tribute to slava,"" was another beauty. dedicated to the cellist and conductor mstislav rostropovich, the orchestra's music director from 1977 to, the concert began with the new york premiere of rodion shchedrin's ""slava, slava (a festive ringing of bells."" anyone familiar with the coronation scene of mussorgsky's ""boris godunov"" will know that ""slava,"" in addition to being a nickname, means glory in russian and that bells are the accompaniment of choice.the program also included alfred schnittke's viola concerto, which rostropovich conducted with the national symphony in 1992 with yuri bashmet, the violist for whom it was written, and shostakovich's fifth symphony, which rostropovich conducted often and recorded twice with the orchestra. this time david aaron carpenter was the excellent soloist in the concerto.mr. eschenbach completed his generous tribute to a predecessor with a shostakovich reading much in the rostropovich manner. a close friend of the composer's, rostropovich insisted that the sense of triumph ostensibly conveyed in the fifth symphony's clamorous ending was actually intended sarcastically, and that he slowed the tempo to make each of the pounding, stabbing a's seem like the hammering of a nail in a coffin.capitalizing on the orchestra's collective memory of rostropovich performances, mr. eschenbach made this interpretation work, rounding out a well-shaped performance. if he occasionally gave in to a predilection for sheer loudness, it was nothing compared with the volume rostropovich could produce in shostakovich.the orchestra sounded in good shape, with particularly fine work from the woodwinds in the shostakovich slow movement.

 context : hong kong — deflation remains firmly entrenched in japan, figures showed on friday, despite optimistic forecasts from the country's central bank, highlighting that there are no quick fixes for one of the world's largest economies . prime minister shinzo abe, who took office last december, has made the fight against deflation — the damaging decline in prices, profits and wages that has dogged japan for most of the last 15 years — a central tenet of his economic policy . at his urging, the central bank committed to a target of 2 percent annual inflation, considered by many economists a healthy level.on friday, the central bank, the bank of japan, under the leadership of its new governor, haruhiko kuroda, put a date on that target: 2015 or early.""various indicators are showing signs that inflation expectations are heightening as a trend,"" mr. kuroda said in a news conference on friday, reuters reported . "" business and household sentiment is improving."""" japan's economy has stopped weakening and has shown some signs of picking up,"" the bank of japan said in its economic report. ""looking ahead, it is expected to return to a moderate recovery path around mid."" the bank cited a likely improvement in domestic demand as the increased money supply and other economic measures announced took effect.the central bank also raised its growth forecasts for this year and the next. the bank said the economy would gradually accelerate to.6 percent growth in the fiscal year that ends in march.the optimistic projections were made as worse-than-expected economic data for march was released by the statistics bureau. core consumer prices, which exclude food, fell.5 percent compared with march, the fifth consecutive month of year-on-year declines.the news added to the doubts of some economists that japan's grinding deflationary era would end soon. the figure ""offered another reminder that deflationary pressures remain strong,"" izumi devalier, japan economist at hsbc, wrote in a research note . although a gradual escape from deflation is expected, thanks in part to higher energy prices, she said the inflation rate was unlikely to match what she called the bank of japan's ""optimistic projections .""the hurdle for reaching the inflation target is ""getting higher,"" miwako nakamura, an economist at j. p. morgan, wrote in a research note .shortly after mr. kuroda took the top job at the central bank this month, it announced unexpectedly bold steps aimed at reinvigorating economic and price growth . the bank committed to inflating the economy by aggressively doubling its holdings of government bonds in two years. mr. kuroda described the program as "" monetary easing in an entirely new dimension."" it was widely heralded as a marked change from incremental steps pursued by his predecessors.the financial markets have welcomed mr. abe's and mr. kuroda's joint efforts. the nikkei 225-stock index has risen 30 percent since the start of the year, while the yen has fallen 14 percent against the dollar — much to the relief of japanese exporters, for whom a weaker yen is welcome as it makes their goods relatively cheaper abroad.several japanese corporate giants, including honda, toyota and canon, have cited the weaker yen as a reason for improved earnings and outlooks in recent days .honda said its net profit for the financial year that ended in march was up.6 percent at.15 billion yen, or.75 billion, according to reuters. mazda recorded a yearly net profit of.3 billion yen, after a.7 billion yen loss in the previous year. growth strategies aimed at stimulating private investment are the most important of the policy arrows in mr. abe's quiver, kunihiko sugio, chief investment officer at invesco japan, said in a recent research note.this ""arrow,"" he added, ""is still in abe's hand waiting to be fired.""

 context : as money flowed into the island's banks after cyprus joined the european union in, the country embarked on a construction boom . he landed a lucrative roofing job, at first for sleek homes and shops, and then for the mansions that took over olive groves and vineyards. the demand for his skills only accelerated after the country was admitted into the euro currency union in.but in the last two weeks, he has watched his finances slide as the foundations of his country crumble during the collapse of the banking system. the severe terms of the country's 10 billion euro ($13 billion) international bailout have tied up everyone's cash, forced huge losses on the strictest savers and are expected to hasten a deep recession that may take years to overcome.mr. alexandrou, 30, says he understands that the crisis in cyprus was brought on by bank mismanagement and even financial corruption .what most pains him and many others here, though, is that central bankers and other international financial officials have, by letting their country's,000 citizens suffer for the sins of a powerful few, shattered cyprus's solidarity with the european union . cyprus is no poor cousin to the european union, they say. instead, it is a country with a small, but remarkably multilingual, solidly educated and until now comfortably middle-class population — people who consider themselves precisely the type of europeans the rest of the union should be proud to have anchor its border with the middle east .many cypriots now feel great shock and anger at what they consider their economic excommunication.""not everyone here is russian, or making money illegally, or laundering money,"" mr. alexandrou said. ""most of us are normal people living normal lives.""he sat, face grim, with his wife, aliki, and their energetic 18-month-old son, alexandros, in the living room of their modern white house on the outskirts of nicosia . ""now we see that nothing good has come from european solidarity,"" he said.for cypriots, joining the european union and adopting the euro were significant achievements. after decades of internal strife and foreign occupation, cyprus regarded acceptance into the european family as a promise of stability and the chance to forge a more modern economy .during the boom times, mr. alexandrou acknowledged, cyprus, like many european countries, lived beyond its means. but while it is time for the country to pay for its follies, he said, ""there is the sense that no one in europe really cares what happens to us.""some of his fellow cypriots have vented their resentment in protests, shouting anti-german epithets and burning the european union flag. cypriots are relatively stoic compared with their more fiery brethren in bailed-out greece, but there is deep-seated anger over the perception that europe is kicking cyprus while it is down.""we made sacrifices to integrate cyprus into the great european family,"" antigoni papadopoulou, a member of parliament, said last week as cyprus tried to negotiate its bailout . but ""there is a real lack of european solidarity,"" she said.with encouragement and subsidies from brussels, cyprus moved away from an agricultural economy toward an emphasis on services that support business, finance and communications. manufacturing was also allowed to lapse, with locally made goods — whether shoes or pharmaceuticals — all but disappearing.cyprus's leaders seized the opportunity to recast the island as a strategic hub at the crossroads of europe, the middle east and asia . their ambition was to emulate the wealthy, discreet european money havens of luxembourg and switzerland, thus securing a comfortable way of life for their people. financial firms and corporations — many of them shell companies — set up shop, or at least mailing addresses. the big draws were an ultralow corporate tax rate of 10 percent and a stable rule of law based on the british legal system.

""i think it will be great when it's 100 percent.""a little over a week after the deadline that president obama gave for fixing the federal health care exchange, the system is definitely working better, according to consumers and navigators interviewed in several states . the technical errors that had bedeviled visitors to the site for weeks seemed to have been tamed by the patchwork of hardware and software fixes ordered by the administration, and applicants were finally selecting health care plans under the president's new law, the affordable care act . by last week, the number of applicants who dropped a plan into their virtual grocery carts was climbing at a rapid clip.still, the interviews indicated, some technical obstacles persist. after shoppers clicked all the way to the plans, for example, the system was not letting some people actually choose one. in other cases, people were asked to try again later.improved entry into the online marketplace has also exposed a new layer of problems and confusion for applicants who are suddenly finding their efforts to buy insurance delayed by requirements that they provide proof of identity or citizenship or that they wait for determinations on medicaid eligibility.for the most part, though, the news for the beleaguered online exchange, which serves 36 states, is improving. since early december, the federal exchange website has run without crashing, officials said. in the first week of december, about,000 people selected plans — compared with about,000 in all of november and only,000 in october. last week, more than half a million people created accounts on the federal website, according to people familiar with the health care project.technical experts involved with the exchange said they are now preparing for a surge of applications before dec. 23, the enrollment deadline to receive coverage by the first of the year. although those preparations will require some significant changes to the system, the work will be easier now that the site seems stable during heavy use, the experts said.in offices spread across the country, from florida and pennsylvania to wyoming and wisconsin, all of them states that rely on the federal government's insurance exchange, navigators and applicants reported far fewer problems.""i was hearing so much about the glitches in the system that i was worried that it wouldn't work,"" said caroline moseley, 54, who lost her job as a housing program analyst for the city of philadelphia . after asking a navigator from the nonprofit resources for human development for help in finding a plan, ms. moseley chose one that costs $27 a month with a,000 deductible. ""it was a great experience,"" she said. ""the site was running very smoothly. it took about 30 minutes tops.""stephanie lincoln, 60, of lansdowne, pa., also had quick success with the exchange — after a frustrating experience trying to submit an application online in october and november. with the help of a navigator, caroline picher, working at the local library, ms. lincoln signed up in just one hour on friday for a policy that will cost $113 a month, with no deductible.""i am one of the people whose plans were canceled,"" ms. lincoln said. ""it was just the easiest thing in the world.""but the smoother functioning of the website has also brought to light new kinds of delays that are creating anxieties for some of the people rushing to buy insurance by the december 23 deadline .at wyoming senior citizens in riverton, wyo., four people walked in on thursday and friday and completed their applications with the help of counselors. after they successfully entered their personal information, the system displayed a message saying they needed to check if they qualified for medicaid, said karla borders, a navigator at the center.

 context : three americans won the nobel prize in physiology or medicine on monday for discovering the machinery that regulates how cells transport major molecules in a cargo system that delivers them to the right place at the right time.the karolinska institute in stockholm announced the winners: james e. rothman, 62, of yale university ; randy w. schekman, 64, of the university of california, berkeley; and dr. thomas c. südhof, 57, of stanford university . their basic research solved the mystery of how cells, which are factories producing molecules, organize a system to transport the molecules within cells and export them outside.as it turns out, the molecules are moved around the cell in small packages called vesicles, and each scientist discovered different facets of what is needed to ensure that the right cargo is shipped to the correct destination at precisely the right time. for example, pancreatic cells make insulin and release it in the blood. chemical signals called neurotransmitters are sent from one nerve cell to another to allow people to walk, talk, sing, pull their hand away from a hot stove and communicate. the molecular traffic within cells is as complicated as rush hour in any city, as the discoveries by the three nobel winners revealed.the world's most prestigious scientific award arrived at a particularly dark time for federal science research: the national institutes of health, the agency that paid an estimated $49 million to help underwrite the winners' work, has been forced to send home most of its staff because of the government shutdown . basic research of the type that just won the nobel is seen as particularly vulnerable to capitol hill budget cutters.""this is a stark reminder of how these are the best of times and the worst of times for american biomedical research,"" dr. francis collins, the n.i.h. director, said in an interview on monday. ""today we celebrate the three n.i.h.-supported nobel prize winners, but we're being slammed by sequestration and a government shutdown .""even before the shutdown, scientists were facing severe budgetary difficulties that restrict the kind of research that led to this year's nobel prize, dr. collins noted. ""how many potential future nobel prize winners are struggling to find research support today, or have been sent home on furlough?"" he said. ""how many of them are wondering whether they should do something else — or move to another country? it is a bitter irony for the future of our nation's health that n.i.h. is being hamstrung this way, just when the science is moving forward at an unprecedented pace.""one of the new laureates, dr. rothman, touched on this point in a news conference, saying that he began his scientific career when ""your idea was the only limit, any risk could be taken no matter how difficult."" he experienced five years of failure before the first signs of success, he said. today, he said, there is less support for risk ideas, ""and it is becoming a pressing national issue, if not an international one.""all three laureates said they undertook their research amid skepticism from scientific leaders .dr. schekman discovered a set of genes that were required for vesicle traffic. dr. rothman unraveled protein machinery that allows vesicles to fuse with their targets to permit transfer of cargo. dr. südhof revealed how signals instruct vesicles to release their cargo with precision.the tiny vesicles, which have a covering known as a membrane, shuttle the cargo between different compartments or fuse with the membrane. the transport system activates nerves. it also controls the release of hormones and enzymes. disturbances in this exquisitely precise control system for transporting and delivering cellular cargo cause serious damage that, in turn, is believed to contribute to some neurological diseases, diabetes and immunological disorders.dr. schekman, who was born in st . paul, minn., used one-celled yeast as a model system when he began his research in the 1970s. he found that vesicles piled up in parts of the cell and that the cause of the congestion was genetic. he went on to identify three classes of genes that control different facets of the cell's transport system. a graduate of the university of california, los angeles, and stanford, where he obtained his ph.d. in, dr. schekman joined the faculty at berkeley in. his findings enabled the biotechnology industry to exploit the secretion system in yeast to create and spit out pharmaceutical and industrial products like insulin and hepatitis b vaccines.dr. rothman, who was born in haverhill, mass., studied vesicle transport in mammalian cells in the 1980s and '90s. he discovered that a protein complex allows vesicles to dock and fuse with their target membranes. during the fusion, proteins on the vesicles and target membranes bind to each other like the two sides of a zipper. the fact that there are many such proteins and that they bind only in specific combinations ensures that cargo is delivered to a precise location; the same principle operates inside the cell and when a vesicle binds to the cell's outer membrane to release its contents.dr. rothman received a ph .d. from harvard medical school in 1976 and was a postdoctoral fellow at the massachusetts institute of technology . in, he moved to stanford, where he started his research on the vesicles of the cell. he has worked at princeton university, the memorial sloan-kettering cancer center and columbia university . in, he joined the faculty of yale, where he is chairman of the department of cell biology.dr. südhof, 57, a united states citizen who was born in göttingen, west germany, studied neurotransmission, the process by which nerve cells communicate with other cells in the brain. he helped transform what had been a rough outline into a number of molecular activities to provide insights into the elaborate mechanisms at the crux of neurological activities, from the simplest to the most sophisticated. a graduate of the georg-august-universität in göttingen, he moved to the university of texas southwestern medical center in dallas in 1983 and became an investigator at the howard hughes medical institute in. in, he was appointed professor of molecular and cellular physiology at stanford .

 context : when the new york philharmonic announced its 2013-14 season in january, it sketched out a major new initiative, the ny phil biennial, in broad terms and a sprinkling of intriguing details. on wednesday, the orchestra filled in more of the blanks, making clear that it is expanding its contemporary-music activities well beyond the composer residencies, the new-music series contact! and the special events that it has embraced since alan gilbert took over as the philharmonic's music director four years ago .the inaugural series, to run from may 28 to june, 2014, positions the orchestra at the heart of an evolving cultural sector concerned with new sounds and fresh ideas. other participants include the orchestra of st . luke's, the american composers orchestra, lincoln center, bang on a can, the juilliard school, gotham chamber opera, the metropolitan museum of art, the museum of modern art, the 92nd street y and the special music high school at the kaufman center.in a recent interview at avery fisher hall, mr. gilbert said that the philharmonic had been mustering the partners and programs for the biennial for two years. ""the idea itself is something i've been talking about and thinking about for much longer than that,"" he said, ""before i was even appointed here: this notion that maybe we could do something for music that has been done in the world of visual arts, famously in venice and art basel and art basel miami and the whitney, these institutions that are now part of the vernacular.""the philharmonic has raised.25 million for the biennial so far, including major donations from the andrew w. mellon foundation, the susan and elihu rose foundation and the francis goelet fund, and is still lining up support, a spokeswoman said.the inaugural biennial includes three programs featuring the entire philharmonic. one, to be presented on may 30 and, pairs julia wolfe's ""anthracite fields"" — performed by the bang on a can all-stars and a choir to be named — with steven mackey's ""dreamhouse,"" played by the philharmonic. it will be the orchestra's first collaboration with bang on a can, a 26-year-old composers' collective born of an expansive, uncompromising aesthetic in some ways antithetical to the philharmonic's conventional sphere.""there were very interesting battles fought, certainly by our mentors, and that was how bang on a can came to be,"" ms. wolfe said in a telephone interview . ""i think that change has come, spurred on by the activities that we've been doing as well as others. in a way, this is an interesting outcome: the friendly, open nation is here.""that the philharmonic is embracing bang on a can, she said, shows that the orchestra is eager to welcome an open-minded new audience with broad listening habits.on june 5 and, mr. gilbert is to conduct the world premiere of symphony no. 4 by christopher rouse, the philharmonic's composer-in-residence, and the first new york performances of peter eotvos's ""doremi,"" featuring the violinist midori, for whom the piece was written. on june, the composer matthias pintscher is to conduct his own ""reflections on narcissus,"" with the cellist alisa weilerstein, and elliott carter's last completed work, ""instances.""both of these programs will also include new pieces selected from an open call for scores through earshot, the national orchestral composition discovery network, a program run by the american composers orchestra with the league of american orchestras, the american composers forum and new music usa. ""that's our way of trying to have our finger on the pulse of really new stuff, untested and unheralded composers,"" mr. gilbert said.the biennial includes two events presented under the contact! banner. one, on may 29 and 31 at the museum of modern art, features works by 11 composers selected by mr. pintscher who were each asked to respond to a specific visual artwork located in salzburg, austria. the other, to be presented on june 3 at the new greenwich village space subculture, focuses on solo works by young american composers. (those events augment, but do not replace, the season's two regular contact! offerings, which include a concert of esa-pekka salonen's chamber works overseen by the composer on nov. 4 and a concert featuring the pianist yefim bronfman on jan. 13, both at subculture.)interspersed among the philharmonic performances are events programmed by partner institutions with divergent but complementary agendas. the orchestra of st . luke's, conducted by pablo heras-casado, will present concerts of works by pierre boulez, george benjamin and their associates and disciples. giants are small, familiar to philharmonic audiences for staging the operas ""le grand macabre"" and ""the cunning little vixen"" with the orchestra, will collaborate with the juilliard school in mounting h. k. gruber's opera ""gloria: a pigtale"" at the metropolitan museum. events presented by the gotham chamber opera, the pianist marino formenti and the kaufman center's youth ensemble face the music offer still other perspectives.such events are fundamental to the biennial's raison d'être, mr. gilbert said. ""the idea was to have curated events — pavilions, if you will — that present different points of view, different threads of composition, of pursuit, of philosophy, of direction,"" he explained, ""so that it's possible for an audience member to immerse him- or herself in a very rich, kaleidoscopic exploration of a lot of things presented together in a way that you wouldn't be able to do otherwise without travel, expense and time.""

 context : ""kafkaesque"" is not a word normally used to describe immune responses, but it's how dr. louis j. picker described what his experimental vaccine did to his rhesus monkeys: ""it's like their t-cells were turned into the east german secret police, hunting down infected cells until there were none left.""recent work by dr. picker, a vaccine expert at oregon health & science university, has shaken up the long, frustrating search for an aids vaccine. his latest study, published in nature last week, has scientists scratching their heads, wondering if it might open up a new avenue for research.dr. picker tested his vaccine in 16 monkeys who were then infected with simian immunodeficiency virus, a close relative of h.i.v., which normally would have sent them spiraling rapidly down to a miserable death. the experimental vaccine protected only nine of them, but it also did something never seen before: these monkeys slowly ""cleared"" the virus and now appear to be cured. ""three years later, you can't tell them from other monkeys,"" dr. picker said.dr. anthony s. fauci, the head of the national institute for allergy and infectious diseases, said the effect was ""unique.""and dr. barton f. haynes, the director of the human vaccine institute at duke university's medical school, said it was ""potentially extremely important to understand how this happened.""scientists often test ideas for potential aids vaccines by creating similar ones against s.i.v. never before has one eliminated an existing infection. in that sense, the effect of dr. picker's vaccine was less like that of a measles or flu shot and more like that of the aids cures used in two famous cases, known as the berlin patient and the mississippi baby.the berlin patient, timothy ray brown, was infected with h.i.v. and cured only by obliterating his immune system to defeat his leukemia, and then injecting bone marrow from a donor with a rare h.i.v.-blocking mutation. the unidentified baby was born to an infected mother in mississippi and apparently infected with h.i.v., but then cured with early and large doses of antiretroviral drugs.both now appear to have no h.i.v. lurking deep in their bodies, but it is impossible to be sure because not every bit of their tissue can be tested.because he works with monkeys, dr. picker was able to do something that would be unthinkable with human patients — necropsy them, grind up every organ and take 240 samples from each to be sure that they harbored no hidden virus.making vaccines by simply weakening the virus that causes aids has failed because the virus mutates a hundred times faster than even the fast-mutating flu virus. in dr. picker's vaccine, s.i.v. genes are fused to those of another virus, the cytomegalovirus. (the name means ""big cell,"" and it is in the herpes family but different from its relatives that cause lip and genital sores, chickenpox and shingles.)h.i.v. fusion has been tried with adenoviruses and others, but cytomegalovirus seems to work better. it's not entirely clear why, but one theory is that cytomegalovirus has a very long history of infecting primates — so much so that 100 percent of monkeys and about 80 percent of humans get it in their lifetimes.therefore, we primates have adapted to it. although the virus can be lethal to fetuses and to those with immune systems suppressed by aids or transplant drugs, in most victims it causes no symptoms.the body responds to cytomegalovirus more slowly and calmly than it does, for example, to a flu.as in any infection, the thymus gland generates new white blood cells called t cells — in this case, cd8 hunter-killer cells — primed to target the specific virus. but in the case of dr. picker's vaccine, those cells stay in an unusual ""half-alert"" state . a full-blown immune response eventually exhausts itself, and can even be dangerous. for example, the rare humans who catch h5n1 bird flu often die of the immune response itself; they drown in the flood of cd8s and other would-be saviors pouring into the lung tissue, spoiling for a fight.that ""half-alert"" state is the ""kafkaesque"" element: unactivated cd8s wander around aimlessly, while fully activated ones behave like storm troopers. but the half-activated cd8s persist in tissues, eliminating their targets quietly without triggering inflammation or even a mild fever.when s.i.v. genes are fused to the cytomegalovirus spine, the cd8s kill s.i.v.-infected cells too.since it protected only some monkeys, the new technique might be best used in combination approaches. for example, dr. fauci said, it could be given with a vaccine that generates antibodies against h.i.v. ""and maybe eliminate the cells that sneak past the antibody shield.""alternatively, the vaccine might be given to infected patients who are on antiretroviral drugs to see if it can ""mop up"" lingering reservoirs of virus.it should take up to three years to get a human version ready for trials, dr. picker estimated .""now the outstanding question is, 'why only half?' "" said dr. mike mccune, an aids researcher at the university of california, san francisco, referring to the monkeys who were protected in dr. picker's trial.too often, aids advances that work in lots of monkeys don't work in many humans.""not all monkeys are the same,"" dr. mccune said. ""they're not as inbred as mice, but they're sometimes from the same families, they get the same diets... who knows what will happen if this goes into humans?""

 context : detroit — less than a week into the season, all the dire predictions about how bad the yankees would be, especially in the first month, are looking quite accurate, but for the wrong reasons .with an 8-4 loss to the slugging detroit tigers on saturday at comerica park, the yankees fell to 1-4 for the first time since. but the poor start has more to do with inadequate pitching than weak hitting.the yankees' biggest concern before the season was that their offense, especially with four of their top position players on the disabled list, would be a problem in april. they hoped their pitching would keep them competitive.but for one turn through the rotation, it has not turned out that way. the yankees have scored at least four runs in three games, but the team's earned run average is.49. only one starter has gone more than five innings, and the bullpen has a.88 e.r.a.the tigers had 17 hits on saturday and scored eight runs for the second straight game in the series.""we've got to get it turned around,"" manager joe girardi said. ""we're swinging the bats o.k. we've got to get our pitching turned around.""on sunday, c. c. sabathia will face detroit's justin verlander in a matchup of aces. but sabathia was inconsistent in his opening day start monday, and his fastball velocity was underwhelming. phil hughes, activated from the disabled list saturday to make his first start of the season, followed the path of most of the yankees' starters so far. he was knocked out in the fifth inning after giving up three earned runs.hughes had a live fastball and pitched well for four innings. but then he could not get an out, and the tigers scored four times to take control of the game.""the fifth inning was a killer,"" hughes said.hughes was summoned to make his first start five days earlier than originally planned because the yankees were so thin in the bullpen that they needed david phelps to remain in a relief role.reliever adam warren, who threw 86 pitches wednesday after hiroki kuroda injured a finger, was still not available. nor was shawn kelly, who threw 43 pitches friday. so hughes was rerouted from his scheduled start for scranton/ wilkes-barre in class aaa and was brought to detroit instead.because of a back problem early in spring training, hughes was behind the rest of the pitchers, and the yankees wanted him to make one more start in the minors.planning to fly to newark and then drive to scranton, he had just checked his bags friday when he received word to change plans. after some difficulty, hughes went back to the check-in counter, retrieved his bags and flew to detroit, through atlanta .still, phelps got his chance to pitch.the score was tied, 1-1, in the fifth after vernon wells's second-inning home run, his second homer with the yankees . austin jackson led off the bottom of the fifth with a single to left against hughes. jackson scored on torii hunter's double to the wall in right- center field, and that brought up miguel cabrera, last year's american league triple crown winner.hughes got ahead of cabrera, who then worked the count full before hitting a curveball into center for a single that scored hunter. it was the 87th and final pitch for hughes, who became the second yankees starter in two days to be pulled in the fifth inning with prince fielder coming to the plate.for the second consecutive day, girardi called upon the left-handed boone logan to face fielder. on friday, fielder drilled a logan fastball for a three-run homer . on saturday, fielder ripped a single into right field that sent cabrera to third, and there were still no outs. victor martinez hit a sacrifice fly to right that scored cabrera, and after andy dirks reached on an infield single, logan was gone in favor of phelps . jhonny peralta then whacked a single to left, scoring fielder to give the tigers a 5-1 lead.the yankees' offense came to life in the sixth and scored three runs, with lyle overbay hitting a two-run single that made the score.the yankees were back in the game, but not for long. the tigers widened their lead again by adding two runs in the bottom of the sixth off phelps .hughes, logan and phelps ended the game with identical.75 e.r.a.'s.""we'll get this turned around,"" girardi said. ""these guys will throw the ball better. i'm convinced of that."" eduardo nunez did not play, one day after he was hit by a pitch on his right biceps, and said his arm was still too sore to throw or swing a bat. ... joe girardi said derek jeter was planning to take easy ground balls saturday and to hit soft toss for the second consecutive day. ... cody eppley was optioned back to the minor leagues to make room on the 25- man roster for phil hughes .

 context : rockne warren newell lived alone in the pocono mountains of eastern pennsylvania in utter poverty . his house was on the verge of collapse. his bathroom was a bucket.but he was intent on keeping his home, even as officials in ross township threatened to evict him over the dilapidated property about 100 miles west of manhattan, which lacked a proper sewage system and was built without the necessary permits. with his only apparent income a $600 monthly social security disability check, he argued that he could not afford the court costs to fight the township nor the required improvements and permits.but the long-running dispute with local government officials reached its end on monday night, when mr. newell, 59, burst into the township's monthly supervisors' meeting in saylorsburg, pa., firing a rifle, and minutes later returning with a.44 magnum revolver, killing three, the police said. in all, he fired 28 rounds at the 15 to 18 people inside the room at the time, the police said. the victims included david fleetwood, 62, a supervisor from neighboring chestnuthill township, who also served as ross township's zoning officer ; gerard j. kozic, 53; and james v. laguardia, 64. it was not immediately clear whether mr. kozic or mr. laguardia had any role in township government .on tuesday, mr. newell was arraigned on three homicide charges and two attempted homicide charges . he did not immediately enter a plea, the authorities said, but when the judge asked mr. newell if he owned any real estate, he responded: ""they stole it from me. that's what started all this.""after he was arrested, mr. newell told officers that he had planned the attack so that as many of the township's officials as possible would be in one place. he told officers, ""i wish i had killed more of them,"" according to the police report.and the toll would most likely have been higher, said lt. col. george bivens of the pennsylvania state police, had mr. newell not been restrained by bernie kozen, a local parks official, after mr. newell returned to the meeting room brandishing the revolver.as mr. kozen wrestled him to the floor, mr. newell continued to fire, the authorities said, stopping only after a second man jumped in and the two men were able to subdue mr. newell until the police arrived.during the struggle, mr. newell was struck by a bullet in the leg, the authorities said, but colonel bivens said tuesday that the police were still trying to determine whether that bullet had come from mr. newell's handgun.though mr. newell's dispute with local officials dates back many years, the animosity apparently grew in february 2012 when, the minutes of the township's supervisors' meeting show, the board voted to take mr. newell to court for failing to adhere to local zoning and sewer rules.then, last october, as part of a last-ditch effort to stave off eviction, mr. newell sought to raise,000 on an internet fund-raising page to pay for legal fees and to make some of the improvements demanded by township officials . in his plea, mr. newell wrote: ""i need to clean up & i need a lawyer, i have no place to go and my 2 rescue dogs will be put to sleep because no one else will take them."" the effort — which he called ""save rocky's home"" — failed to garner a single donation. he was eventually forced to leave his property, according to the authorities .on monday evening, as he was being led away by the police, a television reporter with wfmz-tv in allentown, pa., asked mr. newell why.""they tormented me for 23 years,"" he said. ""i couldn't take it.""

 context : boat of light, boat of stone: the times reporter henry fountain takes a look at two vessels: one powered by solar energy, and one made of concrete.but at the national concrete canoe competition, civil engineering students use a material that is normally the stuff of dams and parking garages to build a 20-foot-long craft that will float even if completely swamped.to do so, they replace the gravel and sand of conventional concrete with exotic materials like glass spheres. the result, to judge by the finals of this year's competition, where 23 teams of 10 or more students gathered at the university of illinois here, is a concrete that is exceedingly light and, with added fibers, strong as well.but as the team from the university of texas at tyler found out, it is not always strong enough.on saturday, after two days of being judged on their engineering know-how and the quality of their final product, the students took to the waters of a nearby lake for races that would count for 25 percent of their overall score. amid the excitement and noise — the mississippi state team had brought along cowbells for the occasion — there was also heartbreak, when the texas -tyler canoe suffered what engineers soberly call catastrophic failure. that is to say, it cracked in half.""we were just paddling along and suddenly i heard a pop"" said marco weider, a captain of the team, who with his teammate was able to get the canoe to shore before it broke in two. with the help of students from other teams, they spliced it back together with large amounts of duct tape.the annual competition has been run by the american society of civil engineers for more than two decades, and is sponsored by companies and trade groups like the american concrete institute.at a time when the nation's approach to science and engineering education has come in for criticism, the contest is a supplement to conventional teaching, giving students a sense of what a civil engineer's life is like after graduation.""it's an experience these students can get that they can't get in a class,"" said corey l. haeder, one of five judges for the competition and chief engineer of a concrete firm in maple grove, minn. (the engineering society also runs a competition in which teams each design and build a small steel bridge.)it also looks good on a student's résum. sarah smith, a captain of the mississippi state team, who just graduated, said she was convinced a main reason she was hired by a civil engineering firm in jackson, miss., was because of her concrete canoe work. her employers, she said, ""knew what kind of time and dedication goes into this.""the teams spend most of the academic year designing and building their canoes, treating the task like a real-world project. they start by picking a theme and a name, and then put leaders in charge of areas like structural design and analysis, concrete mix design (kitchen mixers come in handy for making test batches) and construction (the concrete is usually molded in a marathon session that can last the better part of a day. most teams also put someone in charge of training the engineers to be effective paddlers.according to serji amirkhanian, a judge and a former civil engineering professor at clemson university who is now a consultant, the best teams do not necessarily have better concrete or structural designs. ""it's not a mystery,"" he said. ""the concrete has to be lighter than water.""rather, the winning teams are usually the best organized. ""it takes somebody within the team to take charge,"" mr. amirkhanian said, and persuade others to do the more thankless tasks, especially sanding the surface of the canoe after the concrete has hardened.""nobody wants to sand,"" said mr. amirkhanian, who while judging the canoes on thursday ran his hand along each one to feel how smooth it was. ""but you need somebody telling others you have to sand for hours and hours.""even on a team like that of cal poly san luis obispo, which won the title the previous three years and finished in the top five for four years before that, students will try to avoid that particular job. ""you'll see people taking out the trash, mopping the floor,"" said thomas wong, a captain . ""anything but sanding.""still, san luis obispo does a lot of sanding — 350 hours, mr. wong estimated, out of a total of,000 spent on the project — and it shows. their canoe, called sentinel after the famous domed rock at yosemite national park, looked like it was made of porcelain rather than portland cement.it had plenty of other advanced features as well — including seven post-tensioned cables running the length of the hull, to give the concrete more strength. and in keeping with the canoe's theme, the team had created bas-reliefs of the yosemite landscape on the inside, and cast a pine cone and branch on one of the gunwales.it was all very elegant, but in the end san luis obispo finished fourth . the title was taken by the only canadian participant, école de technologie supérieure, an engineering school in montreal, that produced a beautiful boat, savannah with silhouettes of african wildlife on the side.with its broken boat, texas -tyler finished well out of the top five. the team had selected a golf theme, and had cast golf -ball-like dimples on the side of the canoe, but mr. weider, the captain, did not think they were the cause of the problem. he said the team had displayed the canoe on thursday atop a single golf -tee-shaped pedestal (made of concrete, of course) and that may have caused extra stress.in fact, said césar a. constantino, another of the judges, on thursday they had noticed that cracks were developing in the boat. ""we saw it coming,"" he said.but mr. weider was almost fatalistic about the damage. ""it's concrete,"" he said. ""it's going to crack.""

 context : sciencetake : the jellyfish engine: the moon jellyfish is slow, but there's a reason for that. its undulating pace allows it to swim more efficiently than just about anything in the ocean.the moon jelly, or common jellyfish, is often viewed as a problem, an ecological invader, a nuisance to swimmers, or worse. a moon jelly population explosion last month clogged the water intakes of a swedish nuclear power plant, forcing it to shut down. the jellyfish, which can be 2 to 15 inches in diameter, is such a concern that engineers in south korea designed seagoing, prowling robotic blenders to liquefy the offenders.but a group of american researchers were interested in another aspect of these highly successful blobs: they may be the most efficient swimmers on the planet.brad j. gemmell at the marine biological laboratory at woods hole in massachusetts, and several other scientists, analyzed the movement of the jellies as part of a project funded by the navy to look at what dr. gemmell called ""nontraditional propulsion.""the scientists used a new way of calculating energy called ""cost of transport"" that took account of what was happening throughout the two-phase swimming motion of the jellyfish. in the first phase, the jelly contracts its open bell and pushes water behind it, propelling itself forward. then, the bell returns to its original shape and fills with water again.earlier studies had shown that the jelly got a second thrust during the rest and refill phase, but they had not calculated the jelly's energy expenditure during that time. it turned out that the jelly was not actually doing any work in that phase. instead the elastic tissue in the bell acted like a rubber band, re-forming the bell. that action produced water movement under the jelly, called a vortex, that pushed it forward.the study found that the secondary push was responsible for about 30 percent of the distance traveled by the jellyfish. and it worked even with anesthetized jellies that were pushed through the water. the recovery phase and its kick were purely mechanical. ""that's what makes them so energy-efficient,"" dr. gemmell said.the finding offers some ideas about propulsion that could be useful to the navy. this kind of low- energy, high efficiency thrust would not power any kind of fast-moving, quick-turning ocean craft, but it might be useful for monitoring devices that need to maintain a position or move at a slower pace.it also could be one reason, dr. gemmell said, why the jelly has so much energy to spend on reproduction, producing those problematic population explosions.

 context : some people are troubled by contradictions — by impulses clashing with intentions, needs complicating wants, violence coexisting with compassion. the director claire denis thrives on such things. from her autobiographical debut in, "" chocolat,"" to modernist reveries like ""beau travail"" (1999) and ""the intruder, she has searched for sublimity in the profane and exploited the terror in ecstasy. and while she may be the most independent filmmaker in france, she is preoccupied with belonging, making films about family with the help of a surrogate family of collaborators.in her somber new noir, ""bastards,"" about a sea captain who returns to paris to take vengeance against a powerful businessman for perversions visited on the captain's niece, she dissects with unsettling empathy the dark heart of a family ruined by money and incest.""inside the family you can go from hate to passivity to extreme love within the same hour,"" she said in an interview at the toronto international film festival in september. in her work, that swing can occur in a matter of minutes, whether it's a teenage brother and sister alternating between feelings of repulsion and affection in ""nenette et boni"" (1997) or a woman burying a blade in a father whose legacy she had been trying to preserve in ""white material. ""bastards"" is like the twisted flip side of her 2009 film, ""35 shots of rum,"" which depicted an almost idyllic rapport between a father and daughter. (a retrospective of her career is showing through tuesday at the museum of the moving image in astoria, queens.)yet for all the disruptions within and between ms. denis's films — ""bastards"" is this 65-year-old's first thriller and her first film shot on digital — she has maintained a continuity of collaborators, working with the cinematographer agnès godard on nine features, with the british band tindersticks on seven scores, and with the actors alex descas, isaach de bankolé and grégoire colin on numerous occasions.""it's very strange, this partnership and relationship — we are like brother and sister,"" said jean-pol fargeau, who has worked with ms. denis in paris since ""chocolat,"" and whose own recollections of family secrets helped inform the tone, if not the seedy particulars, of ""bastards."" yet mr. fargeau described a rapport that is rare for siblings, one that flows between work and friendship, the writing desk and the cafe.ms. denis's films may be rife with tension and conflict, but things sound quite different behind the scenes. ""despite the violence or the despair of what she's shooting, the way she shoots it is always with love,"" said chiara mastroianni, who plays the femme-fatale-like lover of vincent lindon, the avenging patriarch in ""bastards."" ""even when claire gets really dark, there's so much light in her.""in conversation, ms. denis can be both generous and contrarian, free with personal anecdotes but vigilant against being pigeonholed or misunderstood. her dark, steady eyes can command a room and punctuate a shyly raspy laugh.she confesses to being uncommonly possessive about her performers, bristling when they appear in films by others. ""they are, like, mine,"" she said. ""i know it's crazy. but i can't believe in them if they don't belong to me. i'm a very tactile person. i touch them. i need to possess them a little bit.""ms. mastroianni, working with ms. denis for the first time, not only expected such intensity going into ""bastards"" but welcomed it. ""i like belonging to her,"" she said, ""because belonging also means that she offers herself to you in the same manner that she wants you to offer yourself to her. it's not a one-way relationship.""between freedom and dependence, partnership and isolation, one always seems to be chasing after the other. when ms. denis married in her late teens (divorcing a few years later, she said it was to escape her family, and her gravitation to film — she assisted jacques rivette, wim wenders and jim jarmusch before going solo with ""chocolat"" when she was 40 — offered her a chance to express herself and ""a different world, a place to hide.""""i reproach so many things about my family, but on the other hand, i kept asking them to be my family,"" she said. though ""bastards"" is not autobiographical, it led her to reflect on how families have their own internal rules and ethics, how they can be a zone of immense love and unthinkable horror, even simultaneously. ""when i was a child i had a nightmare, and in the morning i asked my mother and father, 'if i kill someone, would you still love me?' "" she said. ""my parents were very preoccupied with this, but i think i'm not the only one to ask for that — not love, but absolute fidelity .""""bastards"" functions like ms. denis's childhood nightmare, conjuring situations that would seem unthinkable, except that they recall passages from faulkner and sophocles, as well as the nightly news . though ms. denis's films have been generally well-received, responses to the new film at cannes were sharply divided . but positive notices from the toronto and new york festivals augur a far quicker turnaround than the 12-years-delayed reappraisal for her previously most contentious film, ""trouble every day"" (recently shown at bamcinématek.her films draw you close, whether or not you're ready for what you'll see and feel. ""i don't remember being afraid of anything in making films,"" she said.

 context : washington (ap) — the international space station regained contact with nasa controllers in houston after nearly three hours of accidental quiet, the space agency says. officials say the six crew members and station are fine and had no problem during the brief outage.nasa spokesman josh byerly said something went wrong around:45 a.m. est tuesday during a computer software update on the station. the outpost abruptly lost all communication, voice and command from houston .communication was restored less than three hours later, byerly said""we've got our command and control back,"" he said.station commander kevin ford was able to briefly radio moscow while the station was flying over russia.normally, nasa communicates with and sends commands to the station from houston, via three communications satellites that transmit voice, video and data. such interruptions have happened a few times in the past, the space agency said.if there is no crisis going on, losing communication with the ground ""is not a terrible thing,"" said former astronaut jerry linenger, who was on the russian space station mir during a dangerous fire in. ""you feel pretty confident up there that you can handle it. you're flying the spacecraft.""not only should this boost the confidence of the station crew, it's good training for any eventual mission to mars because there will be times when communications is down or difficult during the much farther voyage, linenger said.in the past few weeks the space station had been purposely simulating communications delays and downtimes to see how activity could work for a future mars mission, byerly said. this was not part of those tests, but may prove useful, he said.

 context : it was an audacious act of gilded age new york. jeannette thurber, a wealthy patron trying to create not just a new american music school but, more broadly, a new american school of music, decided in 1891 to hire one of the greatest composers of the day: antonin dvorak.she offered him,000 a year — more than 25 times what he made at home in prague — and promised him summers off. in exchange, she made him promise to work regular hours six days a week at her school, instruct ""the most talented pupils only"" and conduct concerts.after months of trans-atlantic negotiations, they eventually struck the deal that brought dvorak to new york city in 1892 for an eventful three-year sojourn to lead mrs. thurber's national conservatory of music of america — a period in which he composed some of his best work, including his american-inflected ""new world"" symphony and cello concerto.the contract that brought dvorak to the new world — six pages of gracefully handwritten clauses, bound by green ribbon — was recently discovered in some old files by one of mrs. thurber's great-grandsons after a death in the family. the dvorak american heritage association, which purchased it for an undisclosed sum, will display it publicly for the first time on sept. 8 at the bohemian national hall on east 73rd street in manhattan, to mark the composer's 172d birthday.if its convoluted language sometimes calls to mind another famous musical contract — it can be difficult to read all the discussions of the "" party of the first part"" without thinking of groucho marx's otis b. driftwood in ""a night at the opera"" — the document's enduring musical legacy makes it an object of fascination more than 120 years after it was signed.""jeannette thurber really wanted him,"" said majda kallab whitaker, the curator of the exhibition, which will be held in the hall's dvorak room, and will also display copies of negotiating letters. ""it was part of her showmanship; i like to use the word impresario to describe her. she was really constantly enticing, manipulating, working with the press — the negotiation was not even complete and she was notifying the press that he'd accepted.""dvorak, then, was reluctant, though. his letters at the time mentioned the staggering,000 offer. ""should i take it? or should i not?"" he wrote in one. in another, he wrote: ""what people say of america is very mixed.""one of his six children, otakar dvorak, wrote decades later that it was his mother, anna, who most wanted to go, to improve the large family's finances . in his book ""antonin dvorak, my father,"" otakar dvorak described how his mother forced a family vote at lunch one day — and how his mother acted swiftly after those in favor of the composer's going to new york carried the day.""they went into the study and she gave him a pen to sign the contract,"" he wrote. ""after he returned to the lunch table, father declared that it was not definite as long as the contract was at home. so mother took the contract and delivered it to the post office .""though the contract that will be displayed is signed at the bottom ""antonin dvorak, prague, 1892,"" the date at the top of the contract is not filled in — which ms. kallab whitaker said indicated that the contract may indeed have been signed in haste, as otakar suggested.the contract gives a clear sense of what both sides wanted. mrs. thurber sought an illustrious, esteemed figure to help put her new school on the map, and dvorak strove to make sure he had time to compose.mrs. thurber promised to pay dvorak,500 to the bohemian union bank of prague before his departure, and to give him the rest in installments. she promised that four months each summer would be at his ""free and absolute disposal"" — he spent the summer of 1893 in spillville, iowa, a czech-speaking farm village — and promised him six steamer tickets, first class.dvorak, for his part, agreed to spend three hours each day, six days a week, giving his ""sole attention"" to his duties as musical director of the conservatory. mondays, wednesdays and fridays he was to spend two hours preparing students for concerts and to hold office hours for the remaining hour. on tuesdays, thursdays and saturdays, he was to spend all three hours ""giving instruction in composition and instrumentation to the most talented pupils only.""and he promised to give up to six concerts a year.the exhibition serves as a reminder that mrs. thurber's late 19th-century vision of a music school was in many respects ahead of its time: it was open to female and black students and offered scholarships to gifted students. an african-american student there, henry thacker burleigh, introduced dvorak to spirituals, which informed his american works.""i love dvorak — he's the greatest — but in some ways the amazing hero is also jeannette thurber,"" said michael beckerman, a professor of music at new york university who wrote ""new worlds of dvorak: searching in america for the composer's inner life."" ""if you wrote a novel about somebody that progressive in the 1880s and '90s, people would think you were making it up.""not everything worked out as planned. the panic of 1893 soon ate into the thurber family fortune, and the promised payments to dvorak became irregular. scholars believe that when dvorak returned to prague a few years later, he was still owed several thousand dollars .in the end, ms. kallab whitaker said, the contract served both parties .""jeannette thurber herself said that bringing dvorak here was the greatest source of pride in her 35-odd-year career at the conservatory,"" she said. ""and dvorak, certainly, it's considered that he wrote some of his best pieces here, and he had to know that. he had ample time to explore his ideas here, and was prolific. he has to have been satisfied with it. he was anxious to get home, but he did a lot here.""

 answer : politics 
 context : washington — george w. bush hopes historians will judge his presidency more kindly than his contemporaries have, but a transition coming later this year — the departure of chairman ben s. bernanke of the federal reserve after an eight-year tenure — already casts a different light on the 43rd president's economic record.although president obama has been mr. bernanke's partner in an effort to steer the economy through a financial crisis, deep recession and recovery, so was the man who put mr. bernanke in the job in the first place: mr. bush.""ben bernanke, along with george bush and barack obama, saved us from another great depression,"" said senator charles e . schumer, democrat of new york, echoing the views of others in his party . ""twenty years from now, that's what history will say about all three of them.""that's the same mr. schumer who in 2008 ripped mr. bush's ""disastrous course.""it is a reminder that the administrations of all presidents, sometimes unpredictably, have tails that extend long past their terms in office. and it provides some encouragement for mr. obama as he seeks to leave a mark on the 21 st century economic debate — even if he cannot fulfill his agenda before leaving office.the catalog of mr. bush's economic sins has long been an article of faith among democrats : tax cuts for the rich that turned budget surpluses into deficits, widening income inequality, slow wage growth, a hands-off approach to regulation that ended with the crash of the housing market and wall street . and not just among democrats : mr. bush limped out of office with only about one-third of americans approving of his performance.but the momentary snapshot that political rhetoric encapsulates is only part of any president's story. because of the fed's vast influence over the economy — rivaling or exceeding that of presidents — selecting a chairman may be the single most consequential economic decision a chief executive can make.on the day in 2005 that he appointed mr. bernanke, an academic expert on the depression, mr. bush noted the fed chairman's responsibility ""for containing the risk that can arise in financial markets .""today, few question mr. bernanke's success in helping contain the risks he confronted.""on economic issues, bush was not an ideologue,"" said mr. schumer, who in 2006 led senate democrats to recapture the majority and roadblock the republican president's domestic agenda. ""on his most important economic appointment, he showed who he was.""henry paulson, mr. bush's last treasury secretary, praised mr . bernanke — reappointed by mr. obama in 2009 — for helping produce the ""enormous accomplishment"" of slow but steady economic growth for the last few years even as american consumers were ""de-levering"" themselves of debt . as the country nears the fifth anniversary of the financial crisis, mr. paulson said that mr. bush's critics ignored the reality that the underlying causes of the crisis were decades in the making. he said that mr. bush deserved more credit than he has received for mr. bernanke and for resisting the partisan and ideological polarization of washington when the two stared into the economic abyss.""it's a big part of his legacy,"" mr. paulson said.over conservative resistance, mr. bush backed the bailout mechanisms for wall street and the auto industry that mr. obama later would put into effect. ""he put the political considerations aside and approved taking actions that he knew would be very unpopular with his base,"" mr. paulson said.still, there is no guarantee that mr. bush's appointment of mr. bernanke will burnish the former president's historical reputation, as veterans of president jimmy carter's administration can ruefully attest. the former domestic policy adviser stuart e. eizenstat recalls that mr. carter appointed paul a. volcker as chairman of the fed in, knowing full well that the interest rate increases he planned to tame inflation would harm mr. carter's re-election bid .

 answer : business 
 context : stocks have made investors money for four years, but they have also made them nervous. bonds have been a profitable alternative, but prices are so high that there could be risk in this presumed haven, and in any case yields are near record lows .a popular third choice, stocks that pay big dividends, offers elements of both types of assets: growth prospects and regular income that is often higher than that of high-quality bonds . high-yield stocks have been valuable portfolio holdings for many decades. research by eugene f. fama of the university of chicago and kenneth r. french of dartmouth has found a strong correlation between a stock's total return and its dividend yield .investing with dividends in mind has been especially fruitful lately. it is not clear whether a desire to own high-yield stocks has raised their performance or the other way around, but spdr s&p dividend, an exchange-traded fund that specializes in them, produced a total return of.2 percent in the five years through last friday, compared with.5 percent for spdr s&p, an e.t.f. that tracks the standard & poor's 500-stock index .but have too many hopped aboard the bandwagon? high-yield stocks are often cheaper than the broad market because the sorts of companies that make large payouts tend to grow more slowly. the outperformance in recent years has pushed them to a premium, however; the dividend e.t.f. trades at 15 times earnings versus 14 for the s.& p. 500 e.t.f.that has led some investment advisers to express concern that big dividend payers have grown expensive to the point of being risky. others are inclined to trust the wisdom of the masses this time. they find much to recommend in high-yield stocks, but they urge investors to be selective and to judge companies by more than the amount of cash they dispense.""in order to find a good dividend-paying company, you have to go beyond the dividend,"" said robert shearer, manager of the blackrock equity dividend fund . a company has to have sufficient profits not just to pay the latest dividend, he explained, but also to expand the business so that it can pay future dividends, preferably in successively higher amounts. ""if companies don't have cash to invest in the business,"" he said, ""they won't have it to grow dividends, either.""the ability to increase dividends is an advantage that stocks have over bonds, which have fixed coupons, and some companies raise their payouts year after year. dividend growth is essential, in mr. shearer's view, because a stock's price tends to rise in line with the dividend. that can provide a bigger component of the total return over the long haul than dividend payments themselves.an emphasis on dividend growth can shift the search for the best income -producing stocks away from the sectors most closely associated with high yields, like utilities and telecommunications. mr. shearer said he was finding better opportunities in industrial companies and providers of consumer products and services, in part because those segments of the market had not been bid up as much as the others.""we think there's still value there, but you have to choose sectors appropriately,"" he said.joshua peters, editor of the dividendinvestor newsletter published by morningstar, likewise sees richer pickings in sectors not typically associated with strong payouts, like technology and other economically volatile industries. high valuations elsewhere became a deal-breaker for him.""i trimmed some of the positions i had held for a while and thought highly of because they had gotten too expensive,"" he said, mentioning real estate investment trusts and tobacco companies in particular.robert t. lutts, chief investment officer of cabot money management, is put off by how expensive dividend stocks in general have become.""it has almost gotten to the point where many of these stocks are priced at levels where investors aren't going to be happy with the results going forward,"" he said. ""they're priced at levels that exceed the growth profiles of the companies .""mr. lutts considers valuations less stretched for foreign high-yield stocks . he recommends the global x superdividend exchange-traded fund, which focuses on companies broadly dispersed geographically and commercially. the fund recently traded at just 13 times earnings and yielded.2 percent.""it makes sense to take a global perspective,"" he said. ""there is less potential for price disappointment because the companies are involved in diverse economies and have strength in their industries.""it may be harder to find reasonably priced dividend stocks, but mr. peters is confident that they will continue to appeal to long-term investors after the flow of money from short-term traders eases. very low interest rates can persist only for so long; as rates rise, he said, the ability of companies to raise payouts will give stocks with healthy yields an edge.the rapid rise in the number of people in or near retirement will also underpin dividend stocks as the need for income from all sources increases, mr. peters predicted.""demographic factors are causing a permanent shift in demand for income as a component of total return,"" he said. ""that's a trend that's not going away. dividends are going to play a bigger and bigger role in investors' strategies over time.""

 answer : science 
 context : a dinosaur hobbyist who made his name as a microsoft multimillionaire published a scientific paper on monday alleging ""serious errors and irregularities"" in dinosaur research involving some of the world's top paleontologists.the research, some of it dating to the 1990s, analyzed skeletons of different ages to estimate how quickly dinosaurs grew. for example, a 2001 paper, published in the journal nature, estimates that the giant dinosaur apatosaurus had a growth spurt of,000 pounds in a year.the papers, particularly a 2004 paper in nature on the growth of tyrannosaurus rex, were influential in offering an explanation for why some dinosaurs were much larger than their relatives and slashed decades off the estimated life span of the creatures.the accuser is nathan p. myhrvold, a former chief technology officer at microsoft who is well known in the worlds of avant-garde cuisine and patent law. the lead author of the papers in question is gregory m. erickson, a professor of anatomy and paleobiology at florida state university .dr. myhrvold 's article, published by the journal plos one, says dr. erickson's papers contain major mistakes, including graphs that do not match the data and curves that do not match the reported equations. and dr. myhrvold's revised estimates put the maximum growth rate of apatosaurus at about a tenth of what dr. erickson and his colleagues had reported.dr. erickson declined to be interviewed, but issued an email statement noting that the papers had been the work of teams of scientists and had been peer-reviewed.dr. myhrvold's ""reinterpretation of our data, although reaching moderately different conclusions on a species by species basis, strongly supports the cardinal conclusions that we reached regarding how dinosaurs grew,"" the statement said. ""the bottom line is that the empirical findings of our research group stand, and we stand behind them.""dr. myhrvold, a physicist, said he was not accusing dr. erickson or his collaborators of deliberately falsifying or manipulating data, because he could not know how the errors occurred. but in a letter to nature, science, plos one and other journals that published dr. erickson's work, he raised the possibility .""at the very least these problems are serious errors that merit correction in the literature,"" he wrote. ""the problems also appear to be consistent with scientific misconduct, which may factor into any resulting investigation.""last week, dr. myhrvold emailed the scientists who had collaborated with dr. erickson on the papers to alert them. ""i tried very hard to reproduce the results of these papers,"" he told them, ""and i failed to do so."" in exhaustively describing what he thought were mistakes in the papers, dr. myhrvold wrote, ""this includes cases where the data set appears to have been altered or fabricated.""some of dr. erickson's co-authors agree that the papers have errors that should be corrected. ""i'll be interested to see how greg responds scientifically to nathan's claims,"" said kristina a. curry rogers, a professor of geology at macalester college in st . paul, who was a co-author of the 2001 paper in nature. ""if he has data to the contrary, then he can present that. if he does not, then he can explain that.""dr. curry rogers said dr. myhrvold had provided ample information and explanation backing up his assertions. ""all his methods are laid bare,"" she said. ""anyone who wants to challenge him can do it.""other co-authors of dr. erickson's include mark a. norell, chairman of paleontology at the american museum of natural history ; philip j. currie, a professor of dinosaur paleobiology at the university of alberta ; and peter j. makovicky, associate curator of paleontology at the field museum in chicago .dr. myhrvold said he had raised some of the issues a year ago with dr. makovicky, who promptly acknowledged the errors and was amenable to correcting them.in an interview, dr. makovicky confirmed that ""there is some kind of mismatch in our paper,"" adding that another team member had done the statistical analysis. ""he's right on that point. i didn't produce those numbers. i can't tell you why."" he added, ""i'm happy to 'fess up.""after leaving microsoft, dr. myhrvold founded intellectual ventures, a company that buys patents from inventors. it has been praised for defending the patents, but also derided as a ""patent troll"" for using them to extract lucrative fees from technology companies .he also created ""modernist cuisine,"" a six-volume opus on the science of cooking, and he has published papers on a range of academic topics including climate change, terrorism and dinosaurs. in, his computer models suggested that giant sauropod dinosaurs could have flicked their tails at supersonic speeds.about two and half years ago, dr. myhrvold came across a 2009 paper by dr. erickson as he was trying to answer the question, ""why were dinosaurs big?"" he said data in two of the graphs, one plotting the length of the thigh bone versus age, the other mass versus age, conflicted with each other. ""i instantly knew that this couldn't be correct,"" dr. myhrvold said.dr. myhrvold said he contacted dr. erickson, asking for the original data. while dr. erickson answered some questions, he said the data was on a computer he had gotten rid of and later that he did not have time to answer more questions, dr. myhrvold said.dr. myhrvold was able to obtain some of the data from other researchers and thought he could do a better statistical analysis. last year, he submitted a paper with his calculations — a fairly esoteric scientific disagreement about how best to extract reasonable generalizations from a limited number of fossils.dr. erickson was one of the reviewers and argued strongly against publication. while praising dr. myhrvold's accomplishments and saying the calculations appeared to be numerically correct, dr. erickson said the paper would not advance scientific understanding.""in fact it will hurt our field by producing inherently flawed growth curves, misrepresenting the work of others, and stands to drive a wedge between labs that are currently cordial with one another,"" he wrote.

 context : what is new york live arts? that's been a question in the dance world since an announcement in late 2010 that dance theater workshop, a cherished institution that had been presenting and supporting experimental artists for 45 years, was merging with the bill t. jones/arnie zane dance company . new york live arts became the name of the hybrid.the dance company had been looking for a home, and dance theater workshop had one: offices, rehearsal studios and a 180-seat theater, all housed in a building that the organization had gone into debt to open in. the merger helped pay off the mortgage . that was the bargain. bill t. jones became executive artistic director, but carla peterson, the artistic director of dance theater workshop, also stayed on.what would be the identity of this unusually constituted, curiously named compound? several seasons of performances have provided some answers. still more come on saturday as one of the organization's flagship initiatives bears its first fruit: the debut of ""bell"" by yasuko yokoshi, the inaugural performance to come from new york live arts' resident commissioned artist program.""we're trying to instill in the mind of the public what we're about,"" mr. jones said during a joint interview with ms. peterson in their company offices. ""what is the integrity of this place, and what are we building toward? the resident commissioned artist is us thinking out loud about what that means.""the program is highly unusual in american contemporary dance . beyond commissioning a work it provides an artist with two years of residency that includes an office, rehearsal space and administrative support. there is also a salary and health benefits, a package that adds up to a comparatively huge,000.the idea grew out of ms. peterson's concerns about the struggles of midcareer artists in limbo between hot new thing and revered elder. she had seen many middle-aged choreographers burn out after working, again and again, for months or years with little money on a piece that might receive only three performances. she felt that dance makers and their collaborators didn't have enough time in the theater before opening night, and that artists didn't have the resources needed to achieve at their highest level .""the conversations we have about who we choose are rich,"" ms. peterson said. ""there are a lot of criteria, different in every case, and a lot of institutional self-examination."" ms. peterson said ms. yokoshi made the top of her list because she believed in ms. yokoshi as an artist and thought she had the most distinctive project. her selection would also make a statement ""that we are going to be working on a global stage,"" ms. peterson said.ms. yokoshi, 51, born in hiroshima, has lived in new york since. an independent experimentalist, she can be wild. for her 2003 ""shuffle"" she channeled a japanese goddess, topless, with a large wig between her legs as pubic hair. (that one caught ms. peterson's attention.) since 2003 she has been studying kabuki su-odori, a bare-bones version of kabuki, and incorporating it into her contemporary dance pieces with award-winning results.""bell"" ups the ante by taking on ""kyoganoko musume dojoji"" (""a maiden and a bell at the dojoji temple, a classic kabuki play about a spurned woman who returns as a demon. the work is ""a national treasure,"" ms. yokoshi explained in a west village restaurant. it's ""very inappropriate for me to do,"" and in that transgressive sense, is ""very contemporary art,"" she said.since the demon never quite appears in ""dojoji,"" the work often baffles western audiences. to help, ""bell"" draws connections with another supernatural tale of a woman wronged, the romantic ballet ""giselle.""even with expanded resources ms. yokoshi did not get everything she wanted. where she might have preferred a corps of 12 for the ""giselle"" sections, she could afford only. after two years of development the full cast, which includes new york and japanese dancers, did not meet until the final two weeks. though grateful for the opportunity, she said, she remains wary of what's expected of her and any pressure to become more mainstream.kyle abraham, chosen in november as the second resident commissioned artist, is quite different. at 35 he is a hot young thing, a black choreographer from pittsburgh who has recently received a host of awards. last year he created a piece for alvin ailey american dance theater .mr. abraham said he sees the commission as a chance to build his career and add repertory to his company, abraham.in.motion. a little intimidated by the hype and exposure, he is giggly with excitement about the resources: the office instead of his studio apartment, the meetings that new york live arts has set up with his dream-team list of collaborators, the free tickets to live arts shows, the chance to see a therapist and a chiropractor. (ms. yokoshi, who had never had insurance before, has yet to make use of hers.)in his desire to engage audiences outside the dance world (and show that there is more for black dancers than just ailey) mr. abraham would also seem to fit mr. jones's desire for an artist who is deeply committed to the art form but open to a discussion with the culture at large, one who might even be able to find commercial success on broadway, as mr. jones did in ""fela!"" and ""spring awakening.""""for some of us,"" mr. jones said, ""the quote mainstream is where the true honesty is, and test. if you have something that is so potent that you can have a lot of amens from your crowd, then my challenge to you is to move that into the mainstream and see who is stronger. can you change the water around you, or do you just get changed?""even in an interview the points of view of the two artistic directors converged and diverged. mr. jones expressed pride in ms. peterson's caring for artists. ms. peterson, while recoiling from mr. jones's use of the term ""branding,"" showed a pragmatic appreciation for his expanded view of their mission.""we don't agree on everything,"" ms. peterson said several times, but both directors aim to be leaders in, as mr. jones put it, ""a field that, frankly, really doesn't know what it is anymore.""the back and forth between the two is exhausting, ms. peterson admitted, but it pushes them to consider things they might not have alone.""it forces us both to own up to the truth of what we really believe and think is worth doing,"" mr. jones said.what is new york live arts? it's mr. jones and ms. peterson having a long and heated conversation — fascinating from the outside, fatiguing from within and probably of large significance for dance in new york.

 context : a year ago, before the premiere of the fox drama ""touch,"" tim kring, its creator, was talking about the possibilities inherent in the show's core relationship, between a father and his mute, somewhat mystical son. as the series progressed, mr. kring said, there were lots of things he might do to deepen that relationship. maybe the boy would even speak at some point.but what has happened to ""touch"" goes far beyond the will-he-or-won't-he-talk question. the two-hour season 2 premiere on friday night reveals a series that has become considerably darker and more complex than its earliest episodes suggested. the intricacies may make it harder for new viewers to crack the show without doing some catch-up watching, but they also make it far more absorbing.""touch"" stars kiefer sutherland as martin bohm, a widower who is struggling to raise his son, jake, now. david mazouz deserves some kind of prize for his portrayal of jake (who still, by the way, has not spoken, although his thoughts are heard in voice-over at the beginning and end of episodes. this young actor can get more out of a haunting stare than many adult performers can find in a paragraph's worth of dialogue .jake sees patterns in numbers, and early on it seemed as if all mr. kring had on his mind was having jake use that ability to make feel-good connections among disparate people around the globe. but as season 1 went along, it became apparent that others were interested in jake's unusual talent, most notably a malicious corporation called aster.as the ominous plotlines have emerged, the series has morphed into a suspense drama, with martin and jake on the run (season 2 finds them in los angeles rather than new york) and in constant peril.all of that has been for the better. the we're-all-connected theme is sweet, but by itself it would have grown cloying week after week.perhaps the best decision, though, was to add maria bello in a story arc that began in season 1 and seems poised to become a focus of season. she plays the mother of another child, amelia (saxon sharbino, with abilities similar to jake's. amelia has apparently been kidnapped by aster, and ms. bello's character, lucy, joins with martin in trying to find her and figure out just what the deal is with these special children.giving mr. sutherland a grown-up to play off pays dividends in the season 2 premiere and even provides some romantic possibilities, at least for a while. but the double episode also plunges further into mysticism, with jake's abilities gaining religious overtones, and not necessarily in an upbeat way. a religious zealot (saïd taghmaoui) has some decidedly uncharitable ideas about what should be done to gifted people.""touch"" has a few annoying quirks. for instance, martin, an otherwise smart guy, never does seem to figure out that if he takes his eye off jake for more than 30 seconds, the kid will disappear, following a summons only he can hear. yet another frantic search will result, a gimmick that increasingly feels like filler in this generally rewarding series.

 context : frankfurt — germany, which has often scolded other countries for accumulating too much debt and not being competitive enough in the global economy, now finds its own economic policy under heavy attack .the european commission on wednesday began an extensive review into whether germany's huge trade surplus, which stood at.9 billion euros, or.7 billion, in the second quarter of this year, is threatening the rest of the bloc, a question with fundamental implications for world growth .though couched in diplomatic language, the critique on wednesday from the european commission's president made clear that resentment toward germany in the euro zone had boiled up from the fringes of the region's heavily indebted countries to become part of the official conversation in brussels .there was also criticism wednesday from within germany itself. the government's own council of economic experts accused political leaders of undercutting future growth by failing to invest enough in education and by undoing changes to the labor market that had helped cut unemployment in half. the united states drew attention to the issue last month when it called on germany to do more to stimulate domestic demand, to become a better customer for the rest of europe's goods and services rather than just a consummate seller of german products.the broadsides came at a sensitive time for chancellor angela merkel, who has been in negotiations to form a new government after the german elections almost two months ago .germany stands accused of not doing enough to encourage spending at home as a way to redress the imbalance between its enormous exports of goods like cars and machinery and its more meager imports. many economists and policy makers argue that germany would help itself as well as its neighbors by cutting taxes, investing more in aging infrastructure like roads and water treatment plants and increasing spending on education .such projects would create jobs and increase incomes in germany, the argument goes, and the money would spread to the rest of the euro zone when germans bought products like alfa-romeo cars from italy or took vacations in greece or spain.the council of economic experts warned that in the eight years that ms. merkel had been chancellor, the german government had not built on the deregulation of the labor market that was begun by her predecessor, gerhard schröder. the changes helped cut german unemployment in half, but the council warned that the government seemed to be backtracking on some of the changes.essentially, the council was stating what many people in other euro zone countries have grumbled about for years: that german leaders do not follow their own economic advice."" the german government,"" the council wrote, ""should not give the impression that it expects — or even demands — painful adjustment processes from other countries, but shies away from unpopular measures for germany.""olli rehn, the europe's commissioner for economic and monetary affairs, said on wednesday that ""we are not criticizing germany's external economic competitiveness or its success in global markets . in fact, that is what we want from all e.u. member states .""germans themselves debate whether they invest enough in their own country,"" mr. rehn said. ""more demand in germany can also spill over to the vulnerable countries in varying degrees .""the debate in brussels is analogous to the argument that has taken place for years about the united states' trade deficit with china, said mujtaba rahman, director for europe at eurasia group, a political consulting firm .""these large imbalances aren't good for global growth,"" mr. rahman said. ""what's happening in europe is a microcosm of that conversation.""in berlin, officials of the finance and economic ministries reacted more calmly to the criticism from europe than they did two weeks ago, when the united states treasury department suggested that germany's trade surplus was a threat to the world economy .

 context : the 10 teams of the cape cod baseball league play in low-key neighborhood parks: an archipelago of pristine fields, perfect for showcasing top talent from college powerhouses across the country. you can watch a game from the brim of a grassy knoll and have no signs of commercialization within your sight line. instead of walk-up music, wooden bats are the only sound that you hear, cracking as dusk overtakes the game.the league recently exceeded the mark of,000 major league players produced, including 253 on active rosters in 2012 alone. you can see players pitch faster than 90 miles an hour, turn slick double plays and throw out runners from the outfield with no-hop bullets.the league is the first chance for many of the players to get a feel for hitting with a wooden bat against consistently strong pitching. the teams play almost every day in a 44-game regular-season schedule, but the players come home most nights to share meals with their host families.instead of seeing one or two top players in a college game, scouts and agents can see up to six full rosters perform, counting batting practice, early afternoon games and evening games.vacationers and residents root for their home team, or sometimes both teams, either of which might include the next frank thomas (orleans, 1988), buster posey (yarmouth-dennis, 2007-8), will clark (cotuit, 1983) or pie traynor (falmouth, 1919).

 context : while the federal affordable care act is intended to narrow the divide between those with health care and those without, in its first day of operation the web site aimed at helping consumers sign up for health insurance – healthcare. gov – might have driven a larger wedge between technologically adept americans and those who have yet to fully embrace the social web and mobile technology .the site encouraged people to ""connect"" via twitter, facebook and youtube . it also provided a phone number to call, but doing so resulted in a long wait for assistance.while the site's search feature seemed very intuitive, often returning detailed results for queries, including ""sign up for account"" or ""sign up for coverage,"" some questions returned a blank page that simply said ""no results."" in a bit of unintentional irony, the page then asked if an answer was helpful.those who did make it onto the web site seemed to appreciate the design and aesthetics. the site looks like one for a typical start-up, with clean typography and large identifiable buttons that provide direction. unlike most government sites, healthcare. gov feels like it was built for today's web users, rather than something that still belongs in a 1990s-era web browser .perhaps the best experience for exploring and signing up for the web site is on a smartphone ; the site looks beautiful and is simple to navigate on an apple iphone and devices using google's android operating system . people can even sign up for the service on the mobile web site, not just browse faqs as is the case on the mobile sites of most other government agencies .but not everyone was happy with the look and feel of the overall experience. some complained that the site was too busy and complex, and that navigation was baffling.""the http://healthcare. gov site is kind of confusing,"" gilly wonka of georgia wrote on twitter . a friend instantly replied to mr. wonka, adding a single word: ""very!""while the site took three years to build, it took only a few minutes for it to break down when it went live at 8 a.m. e.d.t.some consumers said they were met with an error message in the early morning when trying to visit the web site, which seemed to be overwhelmed with traffic and limited by apparent programming issues.many people took to twitter and facebook to note that the site was down.""and http://healthcare. gov is already broken …"" kelly campbell, a software engineer for philadelphia, wrote on twitter . ""can't sign up for an account because all the security question options are blank.""ms. campbell was referring to a series of three security questions that were showing up blank for some people, a series of question marks and programming code to others, or simply as error messages.one of the site's error messages read: ""we have a lot of visitors on our site right now and we're working to make your experience here better. please wait here until we send you to the login page. thank you for your patience!"" another declared: ""the system is down at the moment. we're working to resolve the issue as soon as possible. please try again later.""in a statement, healthcare. gov officials said they were aware of the problems and working to fix them.""thanks for all your comments and updates as you enroll. we apologize that wait times on the site and hotline are longer than expected!"" the agency said.

 context : homestead, fla. — the robot gently grabbed the door handle and pulled it open. but before it could shuffle through the frame, it lost its grip and the spring-loaded door slammed shut.team schaft, an elite group of former tokyo university roboticists whose company was recently acquired by google, is one of the favorites to win the pentagon's darpa robotics challenge 2013 trials. but in its first event on friday, the team's 4-foot, 210-pound schaft hrp-2 robot was not perfect. the robot passed through just two of the three doors and as a result failed to get a valuable third point or a fourth bonus point.with computer technology and robot development rapidly advancing, the robotics challenge is a coming-out party of sorts for a new generation of robots that are being designed to walk around in the human environment and collaborate with people on tasks. but the event is much more than a robot showcase; it is also an attempt by the federal government to push technology forward, with the goal of creating machines that can be used in place of humans to perform dangerous tasks.nine years ago, darpa — the defense advanced research projects agency — sponsored the first of three autonomous vehicle ""grand challenges."" that has led to an explosion of activity in self-driving cars.the agency is trying to repeat its success by offering a $2 million prize next year to the team that develops a robot that can perform a series of tasks simulating the kind of things a robot might be called upon to do in a disaster like a nuclear power plant meltdown.there have been a series of prechallenge events this year, building up to the ""trials"" here on friday and saturday . even with all of that, expectations have been set low.rightly so, apparently. the schaft robot, even with its imperfections, performed better than many of the other competitors who have struggled with far easier tasks, like pressing the gas pedal in the golf -cart-like vehicle that the robots are supposed to control or making their way up a ladder. many of the competitors are not even trying all of the eight required tasks, which include driving a car, breaking through a wall, operating power tools and removing debris.gill pratt, the roboticist and darpa program manager who is in charge of the event, said thursday that public perceptions of the state of robot science were unrealistic. ""we've all seen science fiction movies,"" he said at a news briefing. ""and in science fiction movies, robots walk around quickly, they do nice things, sometimes not so nice — and in general they're inside of action films .""he said one reason for the darpa trials was to establish where the science stood, ""as a reference point, as a way for us to learn what is the state of the art right now.""by the look of things here in the pit lane of the homestead- miami speedway, humanoid robots will remain more science fiction than science fact for a while longer.dr. pratt, who before coming to darpa was a pioneer in developing technologies that made it possible for robots to work in proximity to humans, has drawn an analogy between today's robots and human 1-year-olds, who can barely walk and frequently lose their balance and topple over.the question is how quickly the robots will progress. in the case of self-driven vehicles, the rate of progress was much faster than predicted.although the original event ended in failure in, just a year and a half later a number of the vehicles were able on their own to complete a long course over desert roads. in, google shook up the automotive industry with the news that it was testing self-driving cars on california's freeways. now, in the 2014 model year, a number of car companies will offer a feature known as ""traffic jam assist"" in which cars will drive autonomously in limited freeway situations.to add realism to the 2013 challenge event, darpa officials have made it more difficult to control the robots by varying the amount of internet bandwidth that is available to operators at its computer control station. in theory, that rewards teams whose designs are built around more self-guidance and punishes those who manually control or ""teleoperate"" their machines.at the trials, some autonomy is on display. for example, the atlas robot that was designed for seven of the teams by boston dynamics, a massachusetts company, has the ability to walk on its own, as well as balance, a challenging robotics feat. the schaft robot climbs over a debris field largely on its own, with the operator selecting the positions for the robot to place its feet, but the robot then taking the steps on its own.although the trials have shown so far that the teams are struggling to reach even the low bar that darpa has set, there are expectations that a year from now, considerable progress will have been made. indeed, at least one of the teams may try to automate their performance entirely next year.darpa has specified, down to the tiniest detail, what it wants from the teams in the way of the contest, which will help any teams that want to go back to the lab to try again.""it's not that different from the challenge faced by disney engineers,"" said aaron bobick, a georgia tech computer-vision specialist who is a member of the drc-hubo team led by drexel university . and like the walt disney company when designing a new thrill ride, he said, darpa participants find that the challenge is to keep the ride on the rails.

 context : sydney — under-fire australia coach holger osieck has dumped veteran goalkeeper mark schwarzer for friendlies against france and canada after the socceroos' 6-0 humiliation by world cup hosts brazil earlier this month .osieck on tuesday named uncapped mitchell langerak, who plays for bundesliga team borussia dortmund, and belgium-based mat ryan as his two keepers in a 24- man squad, but said 40-year-old schwarzer remained his first choice for next year's finals in brazil .""i know what he can do and his status in the team. he's our number one goalkeeper,"" german osieck told reporters in sydney.""but if i keep playing him, what about the others we may need?""in particular mitch langerak... i think it's about time for him to show what he can do.""schwarzer, who will be 41 next month, holds a record 109 caps for australia and has been a nailed-on fixture in the socceroos' goalmouth for nearly two decades.although hoping to bow out on a high at a third successive world cup, schwarzer has struggled for game-time since crossing from fulham to premier league rivals chelsea, where he stands behind petr cech in the pecking order .twenty-five year-old langerak has only a handful of appearances for dortmund but made his champions league debut for the bundesliga side last week in a 2-1 loss to napoli when goalkeeper roman weidenfeller was sent off in the first half.osieck steered the socceroos through asia's regional qualifiers to book the team's ticket to brazil but the shambolic loss in brasilia has placed him under huge pressure.australian media criticised osieck throughout the socceroos' dicey qualifying campaign this year, and have called on the country's football administration to sack him immediately and find a replacement in time for the world cup .""we're in the early stages of preparing for the world cup,"" said osieck.""we made the major step and we are already there and a lot of great football nations are still struggling and maybe won't even get there.""so to question me then, that's a little bit out of order.""widely regarded to be coaching for his career against france and canada, osieck has recalled attacking midfielder tim cahill and stalwart defender luke wilkshire after the pair missed the brazil match due to injury. uncapped jackson irvine, a 20-year-old midfielder playing in scotland's top flight, has joined the squad for the first time. japan -based defender lucas neill is set to captain the socceroos' for a record-equalling 60th time in the october 15 match against canada in london, which follows the october 11 clash against france in paris.

 context : in the recovery so far, small businesses have largely been left behind. initially, loans were hard to come by and consumers weren't shopping. now, small-business owners say, washington is throwing up additional roadblocks.in survey after survey, owners of small businesses report unbridled pessimism about the economy . the small-business optimism index from the national federation of independent business — a major industry group for small businesses that surveys a sample of its members each month — is stuck at recessionary levels. in january's report, released this week, expectations for business conditions six months from now were at their fourth- lowest reading in nearly 40 years.comparable measures for large companies have exceeded their prerecession levels. that is partly because big companies have a larger global footprint, so they are benefiting from strong growth in places like china and india . small businesses are more closely tied to the leaden domestic economy, said paul ballew, chief analytic and data officer at dun & bradstreet, so weak growth at home is weighing more heavily on them.that gulf in optimism between small and large companies seems to widen, though, during occasions of greater policy uncertainty and washington gridlock — including the present. and while small businesses always grumble about taxes and regulation, they are especially likely to do so now. asked by the national federation of independent business about their ""single most important problem,"" small-business owners are now as likely to name taxes or government requirements as they are to name sales, which had reigned supreme from september 2008 until mid."" politicians are uniformly quick to offer paeans to small businesses, but their actions have directly held back the sector, to the huge detriment of the economy,"" said ian shepherdson, chief economist at pantheon macroeconomic advisors. ""the timing of this latest slump is particularly frustrating because the key precondition for a real small-business recovery — the normalization of bank lending to commercial and industrial companies — is within reach.""it is unclear why policy and economic uncertainty would be taking a greater toll on small versus large businesses .smaller companies might have be more alarmed by headlines about the debt ceiling and fiscal tightening because they don't have armies of in-house analysts to advise them about relative risks, said nicholas bloom, an economics professor at stanford who maintains an index on policy uncertainty.smaller businesses are also more fixated on domestic uncertainty because they are less diversified than big firms — both geographically and in terms of product lines — and so have smaller margins for error. the last several years have offered multiple false starts in the domestic economy (remember "" recovery summer"" in?), and small businesses that acted on any sense of optimism often found themselves badly burned.ralph jensen, president of pro data iv, a nine-person accounting and bookkeeping firm in green bay, wis., has watched and learned. he would like to open another office in appleton, about 30 miles south, and hire a new employee. but he is concerned about how another blowup in washington, or at the very least lingering uncertainty about tax increases and spending cuts, might affect his clients' expansion plans.unlike a big company that can take a tax write-off for investing in space or equipment it ends up not needing, ""i just don't have much wiggle room if i fail,"" he said.before he would feel comfortable expanding, he said, ""i'd have to see my business is growing consistently for a long time, and i would have to have really, really strong faith in the fact that people were going to be opening more businesses around here that would be looking for services like mine.""no matter what fiscal showdown washington might have in the coming weeks, recent congressional decisions have already had concrete effects on the economic security of small businesses .many business owners report continued confusion about what their health care liabilities will be in, for example, when some employers will be required to offer health insurance and other changes to health benefits kick in.owners who sell directly to consumers say they are also concerned about the effects that congress's recent tax increases, like the end of the payroll tax holiday, will have on their bottom line.""you know i'm in kind of a unique situation in that i don't sell anything that anybody needs, the way you need groceries or some other things,"" said jason starkey, the owner of starkey products, in orange city, fla., which sells lighting products and other accessories that are installed in new cars. ""i know i've noticed the tax hike that just occurred, so people making,000 to,000, the people who buy our products, must be noticing it, too.""

 context : midland city, ala. — the vigils continued in and around this southeastern alabama town on saturday. they were held in private homes, at the gazebo next to city hall and, perhaps most somberly, on the grassy hill where swarms of federal agents were watching the underground bunker where, they said, a man named jimmy lee dykes had held a 5-year-old boy hostage for more than four days. law enforcement officials were still saying little about attempts to rescue the boy, who was kidnapped on tuesday when mr. dykes raided a school bus and killed the driver. officials have been in constant contact with mr. dykes via cellphone . and they have passed things to him through a plastic pipe that, a neighbor said, was originally installed to allow mr. dykes to eavesdrop on trespassers from within the bunker.the bunker had food and electricity, and sheriff wally olson of dale county said in a news conference on saturday that it also had blankets and an electric heater to get through the near- freezing temperatures at night. he added that toys, coloring books, potato chips and medication had been passed into the bunker for the boy, who has asperger's syndrome and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder .he did not say if it was known whether the boy had been taking the medicine.""it's one thing when you've got your mother and grandmother giving it to you every day,"" said steve clouse, a state representative whose district includes midland city.perhaps suggesting that mr. dykes was following events from his bunker, sheriff olson concluded the short news conference by offering gratitude to mr. dykes for allowing officials to pass on such necessities.""i want to thank him for taking care of our child,"" the sheriff said. ""it's very important.""the daily mail of london reported on saturday that mr. dykes had initially made a request to local authorities that he deliver his grievances to a reporter in exchange for handing over the boy. two people familiar with the early hours of the operation corroborated the daily mail's account, one adding that mr. dykes even had a particular reporter in mind.neighbors described mr. dykes as perpetually either threatening others or seeing himself as under threat, his interactions with them limited to conspiratorial tirades against the government or warnings of violence, sometimes by brandishing a gun.""he told us it was his land and anybody that went onto it would be killed,"" said ronda wilbur, 55, who lives next to mr. dykes and said he once had beaten her dog with a lead pipe after it walked onto his property.before federal agents were stationed on his property and the national news media was camped out across the street, mr. dykes spoke in paranoid tones about surveillance and the government, neighbors said.""he was more and more antigovernment, antipolice, anti-everything,"" said ms. wilbur's husband, john wilbur, 59.mr. dykes, who has lived in a travel trailer here for about two years, has a troubled past, including arrests on charges connected to drugs, drunken driving and, in florida in, unlawful display of a firearm. on wednesday he was due in court in this county, accused of shooting at a neighbor in a dispute over driving on his property.but the most telling indications of his troubles may lie outside the official record.at midnight, when people would come home from late shifts, mr. dykes would be digging with a shovel in the red clay behind his trailer. or he would be on patrol, walking the perimeter of his compound with a flashlight and a long gun.before building the bunker, mr. dykes made long, snaking mounds out of dirt and odd structures out of cinder blocks. he built the bunker in about three months, said a neighbor, michael creel, 28, who described it as four to five feet wide by six feet long, made of plywood and lined with plastic insulation and sandbags.mr. creel said he was admiring mr. dykes's okra bed one day when mr. dykes invited him to see the bunker. ""it kind of threw me off the first time i climbed down in there,"" he said. ""he said: 'climb down in there and holler. see if we can hear you.' that was a little bit of a red flag .""mr. creel said he believed that mr. dykes had several handguns, including an antique colt .45, as well as a rifle and a shotgun. other neighbors said they had heard mr. dykes firing what sounded like a semiautomatic weapon in the field behind his property.mr. creel's father, greg, said he had been subpoenaed to appear in the case involving the dispute with the neighbor. he said mr. dykes had given him a handwritten letter several pages long, presumably in connection with the trial.mr. creel, 65, said he had not wanted to read the letter and had handed it over to law enforcement . ""i am sure it gives insight to this man's crazed mentality,"" he said.meanwhile, people in town continued to gather each night at a gazebo on the grounds of city hall, where they held candles in salt-filled plastic cups. friday night's vigil began with announcements: a reminder to eat at the local ruby tuesday, which was making donations to the family.a mother of one of the boy's classmates spoke. there were prayers, for the family of the bus driver, charles albert poland jr., 66; for the boy and his family; even for mr. dykes.they closed, as usual, with a chorus of ""amazing grace,"" and then resumed the long wait .

 context : soon after the 10th anniversary of the foundation bearing his name, bill clinton met with a small group of aides and two lawyers from simpson thacher & bartlett. two weeks of interviews with clinton foundation executives and former employees had led the lawyers to some unsettling conclusions.the review echoed criticism of mr. clinton's early years in the white house : for all of its successes, the clinton foundation had become a sprawling concern, supervised by a rotating board of old clinton hands, vulnerable to distraction and threatened by conflicts of interest. it ran multimillion-dollar deficits for several years, despite vast amounts of money flowing in.and concern was rising inside and outside the organization about douglas j. band, a onetime personal assistant to mr. clinton who had started a lucrative corporate consulting firm — which mr. clinton joined as a paid adviser — while overseeing the clinton global initiative, the foundation's glitzy annual gathering of chief executives, heads of state, and celebrities.the review set off more than a year of internal debate, and spurred an evolution in the organization that included mr. clinton's daughter, chelsea, taking on a dominant new role as the family grappled with the question of whether the foundation — and its globe-spanning efforts to combat aids, obesity and poverty — would survive its founder.now those efforts are taking on new urgency. in the coming weeks, the foundation, long mr. clinton's domain since its formation in, will become the nerve center of hillary rodham clinton's increasingly busy public life.this fall, mrs. clinton and her staff will move into offices at the foundation's new headquarters in midtown manhattan, occupying two floors of the time-life building. amid speculation about her 2016 plans, mrs. clinton is adding major new initiatives on women, children and jobs to what has been renamed the bill, hillary & chelsea clinton foundation .worried that the foundation's operating revenues depend too heavily on mr. clinton's nonstop fund-raising, the three clintons are embarking on a drive to raise an endowment of as much as $250 million, with events already scheduled in the hamptons and london. and after years of relying on bruce r. lindsey, the former white house counsel whose friendship with mr. clinton stretches back decades, to run the organization while living part-time in arkansas, the family has hired a new york-based chief executive with a background in management consulting.""we're trying to institutionalize the foundation so that it will be here long after the lives of any of us,"" mr. lindsey said. ""that's our challenge and that is what we are trying to address.""but the changing of the guard has aggravated long-simmering tensions within the former first family's inner circle as the foundation tries to juggle the political and philanthropic ambitions of a former president, a potential future president, and their increasingly visible daughter.and efforts to insulate the foundation from potential conflicts have highlighted just how difficult it can be to disentangle the clintons' charity work from mr. clinton's moneymaking ventures and mrs. clinton's political future, according to interviews with more than two dozen former and current foundation employees, donors and advisers to the family. nearly all of them declined to speak for attribution, citing their unwillingness to alienate the clinton family.last thursday, mr. clinton arrived two hours late to an exuberant welcome at a health clinic about 60 miles north of johannesburg. children in zebra-striped loincloths sang as mr. clinton and ms. clinton made their entrance, and the former president enthusiastically explained how his foundation had helped the south african government negotiate large reductions in the price of drugs that halt the progress of hiv. aaron motsoaledi, south africa's minister of health, heaped praise on the effort. ""because of your help we are able to treat three and a half times more people than we used to,"" he told the crowd .the project is typical of the model pioneered by the clinton foundation, built around dozens of partnerships with private companies, governments, or other nonprofit groups . instead of handing out grants, the foundation recruits donors and advises them on how best to deploy their money or resources, from helping procter & gamble donate advanced water-purification packets to developing countries to working with credit card companies to expand the volume of low-cost loans offered to poor inner city residents .

 context : washington — three members of the u.s. naval academy football team are being investigated for the alleged sexual assault of a female student, the pentagon said on friday, the latest in a string of scandals that have thrown a spotlight on sex crimes in the military .the alleged incident took place in april, when the student attended a party at the off-campus "" football house"" in annapolis, maryland and became intoxicated, her attorney, susan burke, said in a statement.""she woke up at the football house the next morning with little recall of what had occurred. she learned from friends and social media that three football players were claiming to have had sexual intercourse with her while she was incapacitated,"" burke said, without identifying her client by name.no charges have yet be brought against the accused men, sources familiar with the matter said.the disclosure of the alleged incident comes just a week after president barack obama, in a speech at the same academy on may, urged graduates to stamp out sexual assault from their ranks. obama said sexual assault was a crime that threatened to erode trust and discipline within the military .the naval academy, which is located in annapolis, declined to offer any details, beyond saying that the academy leadership was monitoring progress of the investigation and would ""evaluate the appropriate options for adjudication.""""it is completely inappropriate to make any other public comment on this investigation or any ongoing investigation as we risk compromising the military justice process,"" said commander john schofield, a spokesman for the academy.the pentagon said only that the accused aggressors belonged to the football team and that the victim was a female student.""there is absolutely no place for this in the united states military,"" said colonel steve warren, a pentagon spokesman, commenting broadly on the issue of sexual assault .burke said that one of the football players pressured the woman not to cooperate with an initial investigation into the case . she initially followed that advice, but was still ""ostracized and retaliated against by the football players and the naval academy community."" she was also disciplined for drinking, burke said in a statement.in early, the female student decided to seek legal help and the navy re-opened the investigation, burke said.""over time, the midshipman began to recover from the trauma, and became angered at the lack of justice and retaliation in her case,"" she said.reuters was unable to identify the men accused in the case or find their attorneys . students at the naval academy are known as ""midshipmen.""the case is the latest in a series of sex-related scandals in the u.s. military that have come to light in recent weeks, including cases in which military advocates for victims of sexual assault were themselves accused of sex crimes .a study released in may by the defense department estimated that reports of unwanted sexual contact in the military, from groping to rape, rose 37 percent in, to about,000 cases from,000 the previous year.next week, the top uniformed officers of all the branches of the u.s. military will appear before congress to testify about sexual assault as lawmakers weigh legislation to address the issue .one proposal would take responsibility for prosecuting sex crimes out of the victim's chain of command and put it in the hands of specialized prosecutors .burke criticized the naval academy's handling of the case, saying it was inappropriate that the players were able to keep playing with ""no adverse consequences.""the naval academy is not the only elite u.s. military institution stained by recent allegations of sexual assault .a sergeant at the u.s. military academy at west point stands accused of videotaping female cadets in the showers . he has been charged with indecent acts, dereliction of duty and cruelty, the army said.u.s. defense secretary chuck hagel spoke with graduates at west point on saturday, calling sexual assault a ""scourge"" on the military .

""it really drove my detractors crazy because i had the joy of jesus in me, and they didn't understand it.""the decision by the third court of appeals, which voted 2 to 1 on party lines, was the latest time that a high-profile prosecution of an elected official invoking unusual legal theories has been stymied by an appeals court or stumbled in the legal process . others who avoided convictions or had them overturned include former senator john edwards of north carolina and former senator ted stevens of alaska.from the start, many republicans had denounced this prosecution as politically motivated overreach.still, given the long list of ethical questions that have clouded mr. delay's career — the former congressman said he had spent nearly $12 million on legal bills, fending off everything from the congressional ethics committee to the department of justice — the decision appears to fall short of a complete ethical cleansing.when he stepped down as majority leader in, and later decided not to seek re- election from his district in sugarland, mr. delay, now, faced not only the indictment in texas but also an investigation by the department of justice into his relationship with jack abramoff, a lobbyist at the heart of an ethics investigation.the justice department never brought charges against mr. delay for, among other things, accepting gifts from mr. abramoff like a 10-day golf trip to scotland and england for mr. delay, his wife and some staff members .mr. delay's lawyer, brian w. wice, said that the investigations had ""ruined his life in large part,"" but that mr. delay viewed the decision as a vindication — a chance to restart his career.""now that this sword of damocles has been removed, i would think he could do almost anything he wanted to do,"" he said.mr. delay has been free on a,000 bond. he has been anything but low profile, delivering speeches, offering consulting advice, writing a blog and — in a career turn that might have eclipsed his work in washington — appearing on ""dancing with the stars"" while wearing a vest with leopard trim.""they never got rid of me,"" mr. delay said. ""you may see my shadow or footprints around over the last seven years. i've been active.""mr. delay was convicted with two associates of funneling,000 in corporate contributions through the republican national committee to republicans running for the state legislature in. the election had national implications: mr. delay was looking to lock in republican control of the legislature as it prepared to redraw congressional district lines.and after that election, republicans in texas pushed through a redistricting plan that markedly changed the playing field in favor of republicans, strengthening mr. delay's control in washington .this was the first time that prosecutors in texas had attempted to use a money-laundering statute against a politician charged with trying to circumvent the state ban on corporate contributions that has been in place since. mr. delay never denied he engaged in the practices described in the indictment, but said they were common and legally accepted campaign practices.in its decision, the court flatly rejected the case brought against him.""the evidence was legally insufficient to support delay's convictions,"" justice melissa goodwin wrote for the majority. ""the fundamental problem with the state's case was its failure to prove proceeds of criminal activity .""the travis county district attorney's office said it was considering whether to appeal to the full texas court of criminal appeals . ""we are concerned and disappointed that two judges substituted their assessment of the facts for that of 12 jurors who personally heard the testimony of over 40 witnesses over the course of several weeks and found that the evidence was sufficient and proved delay's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt,"" the office said.mr. wice, who described himself as a close friend and ""a consigliere"" to mr. delay — ""i've been doing this for 30 years and you want to win them all, but i never wanted to win one more than this one"" — said that he did not expect the appeals court to overturn the decision, and that he thought it unlikely they would even take it up.""i've clerked at that court, i've followed it since the truman administration,"" he said. ""i am confident that they are not going to look at the case . you didn't need to be a legal genius to see that the money-laundering statute doesn't apply here.""as he talked to reporters, mr. delay traced his problems back to, when the democratic congressional campaign committee began filing ethics charges against him.""i have raised and spent on legal fees over that period over $12 million,"" he said. ""but that's what they wanted to do, they wanted to destroy me.""
