politics,"the american academy of pediatrics declared its support for same-sex marriage for the first time on thursday, saying that allowing gay and lesbian parents to marry if they so choose is in the best interests of their children.the academy's new policy statement says same-sex marriage helps guarantee rights, benefits and long-term security for children, while acknowledging that it does not now ensure access to federal benefits . when marriage is not an option, the academy said, children should not be deprived of foster care or adoption by single parents or couples, whatever their sexual orientation .the academy's review of scientific literature began more than four years ago, and the result is a 10- page report with 60 citations.""if the studies are different in their design and sample but the results continue to be similar, that gives scientists and consumers more faith in the result,"" said dr. ellen perrin, a co-author of the new policy and a professor of pediatrics at tufts university school of medicine .other scientists called the evidence lackluster and said the academy's endorsement was premature. loren marks, an associate professor of child and family studies at louisiana state university in baton rouge, said there was not enough national data to support the pediatric association's position on same-sex marriage . ""national policy should be informed by nationally representative data,"" he said. ""we are moving in the direction of higher-quality national data, but it's slow.""the academy cited research finding that a child's well-being is much more affected by the strength of relationships among family members and a family's social and economic resources than by the sexual orientation of the parents. ""there is an emerging consensus, based on extensive review of the scientific literature, that children growing up in households headed by gay men or lesbians are not disadvantaged in any significant respect relative to children of heterosexual parents,"" the academy said.a large body of evidence demonstrates that children raised by gay or lesbian parents fare as well in emotional, cognitive and social functioning as peers raised by heterosexuals, the academy said.one study in england compared 39 families with lesbian mothers to 74 heterosexual parents and 60 families headed by single heterosexual women. no difference was found between the groups in emotional involvement, abnormal behaviors in children as reported by parents or teachers, or psychiatric disorders in them. both mothers and teachers reported more behavioral problems among children in single-parent families than two-parent ones, whatever their sexual orientation .a 2010 study of children born to 154 lesbian parents in the united states compared mothers' reports of their 17-year-olds to a national sample of age-matched peers. the mothers' reports indicated that their sons and daughters had high levels of competence and fewer social problems, compared with their peers."" marriage strengthens families and benefits child development, and it also increases a parent's sense of competence and security when they are able to raise children without stigma,"" said dr. nanette gartrell, the lead author of the study and a visiting scholar at the university of california, los angeles, school of law.the research on same-sex marriage has limitations, experts note, including the relatively small sample sizes of gay or lesbian parents even in long-term studies. many studies have relied on parental assessments of their children's well-being, and there is relatively little data about the well-being of children raised by gay men compared with lesbians.""many studies compare wealthy, well-educated lesbian mothers to single heterosexual mothers instead of married couples,"" dr. marks said. ""this matters, because children from married families do better on numerous outcomes including psychological and physical health and avoidance of high-risk behaviors than children of single-parent families.""timm ryan-young, a 48-year-old married brooklynite and father of zelia, 6, found the academy's support of same-sex marriage reaffirming.""whenever a formal institution validates or confirms that a same-sex family is valid,"" he said, ""and there are no measurable negatives to it, or deterrents to it, it means a great deal, frankly.""dr. travis kidner, 36, a surgeon in los angeles, and hernan lopez, 42, a media executive, married in 2008 and adopted nicholas, 2 1/2 years old, and zoe, 21 months. ""it's important for kids to know they are from a stable home and that their parents are married,"" dr. kidner said.the pediatrics academy's support for same-sex marriage heartened him. ""the arc is in our favor now,"" he said.another reason same-sex couples should be allowed to marry, the academy said, is that divorce law provides for a legally structured arrangement for visits and custody.""if people can't get married, then they can't get divorced,"" dr. perrin said. ""that legal system that exists to protect our most vulnerable, namely children, isn't in play.""",205
science,"applying a coating to microscopic objects like bacterial cells or colloidal particles has a wide array of potential applications in medicine and environmental science, like fending off corrosion and making medications go down easier. the trouble is that the process is difficult and expensive.until now, that is. writing in the journal science, researchers in australia say they have developed a coating technique that is quick, cheap and natural. using iron ions and a natural polyphenol known as tannic acid, the researchers say they have created thin, nontoxic films that instantly assemble themselves on any number of substances.current methods of coating ""are time-consuming, involve multiple steps or require expensive, often synthetic materials,"" frank caruso, an author of the paper and a professor at the university of melbourne, wrote in an e-mail. ""we have developed a rapid coating method from naturally occurring, generally recognized as safe, inexpensive materials"" that can be ""deposited on a diverse range"" of substances.the new method is versatile enough to uniformly coat substances of varying shape, size, structure and composition, say the researchers, and can be applied equally to organic and nonorganic compounds — even living ones. the film it creates should also disassemble itself naturally under the right conditions, allowing for the timed release of substances within.dr. caruso and his team are testing potential applications for the coating that involve biomedical imaging (like ct and mri scans) and metal ion separation. they are also examining the coating's stability and its ability to disassemble in various environments.",486
science,"los angeles — nasa's opportunity rover is rolling across the martian surface again, leaving behind a clay-rich rock in search of more discoveries.mission managers said friday that the plan calls for arriving at its new destination — 1 1/2 miles to the south — by august so that the solar-powered rover can be in a favorable spot before the next martian winter.opportunity has been exploring endeavour crater since. it's the largest of five craters examined by the six-wheel rover so far and contains some of the oldest deposits dating back to the first billion years of mars' history.before trekking off last month, opportunity used a grinder to scrape away the top layer of a light-colored rock for a peek inside. the rock was so lumpy and covered with crud that it took the rover several tries to crack open its secrets .unlike other rocks that opportunity inspected during the past nine years, the latest told a different story: it contained clay minerals, a sign that water coursed through it, and formed in an environment that might have been suitable for microbes.previous rock studies by opportunity pointed to a watery past on mars, but scientists said the water was acidic.""this is water you can drink,"" said mission chief scientist steve squyres of cornell university .since landing on opposite ends of the red planet in, opportunity and its twin, spirit, have impressed scientists with their longevity. both outlasted their original, three-month warranty.while opportunity continues to plow ahead, spirit's mission came to an end when it got stuck in sand and stopped communicating in. project manager john callas said opportunity showed signs of wear, but was otherwise in good health. it recently experienced a bout of amnesia with its flash memory, but callas said it was not serious.opportunity is not the only mars rover on the move. earlier this week, nasa said its newest rover, curiosity, will soon head to a martian mountain.",483

a survey conducted from may 8 to 13 by quinnipiac university showed that 44 percent of virginia voters saw the revelations as ""just politics.""in the opening act, virginians were introduced to todd schneider, the former personal chef to the governor and his family, who kept a stash of the first lady's favorite crab-seasoned popcorn in the kitchen of the executive mansion .mr. schneider, 52, told law enforcement agents last year that a,000 catering bill for the wedding of the mcdonnells' middle daughter, a menu that included bruschetta with local tomatoes and virginia wines, was footed by a political donor.although state law requires elected officials to report gifts, mr. mcdonnell did not declare the,000, later explaining that it was exempt because it was a gift to his daughter.mr. schneider, who calls himself a whistle-blower in court filings, showed investigators the catering contract signed by mr. mcdonnell, an invoice noting that he put down a deposit and a,000 check from the political patron who ultimately bought the food.that donor, a serial entrepreneur named jonnie r. williams sr., has given more than,000 to mr. mcdonnell's campaigns, including nearly,000 in corporate jet travel, according to the virginia public access project, which tracks money in politics.the mcdonnells have returned the attention. three days before the wedding of their daughter cailin in june, maureen mcdonnell, the first lady, flew to florida on mr. williams's plane to promote a dietary supplement sold by mr. williams . she ""wowed"" investors, one wrote, at a meeting to discuss the supplement, anatabloc, which is said to have anti-inflammatory properties.later that summer, ms. mcdonnell gave a luncheon at the executive mansion, a stately federalist home in pale yellow brick, to officially introduce anatabloc the week it appeared in stores, speaking to a group of local health care providers .agents have questioned people who know the mcdonnells to determine if there was an improper quid pro quo between mr. williams and the governor and first lady to advance mr. williams's business . in court documents, mr. schneider says he and at least one other executive mansion employee were interviewed by agents. a spokeswoman for the richmond f.b.i. office would neither confirm nor deny the accounts.mr. mcdonnell, 58, has called mr. williams a friend and said he did nothing for his company, star scientific, that he would not do to promote any other virginia business .""i think it's important that the people of virginia know that nothing has been done with regard to my relationship with mr. williams or his company star scientific to give any kind of special benefits to him or his company,"" the governor said on wtop radio.mr. williams, 57, who until recently paid himself $1 million a year as a chief executive of star scientific, which has lost money for a decade, has a history of promoting over-the-counter treatments and a parallel history of running afoul of regulators . two decades ago he was ordered to pay,000 for pumping up a stock with false claims about an anti-wrinkle cream named lacramore.in march, star scientific, which sells two dietary supplements and two face creams, revealed it was the target of a federal investigation into its stock.a lawyer for mr. williams, jerry kilgore, did not respond to requests for comment .another friend of mr. williams's is virginia's attorney general, mr. cuccinelli. mr. cuccinelli has reported,000 in gifts from mr. williams, including regular vacations at a house on smith mountain lake, near roanoke, and a catered,500 thanksgiving dinner. he also received a box of anatabloc.mr. cuccinelli, 44, bought stock in star scientific, which at one time was worth more than,000, although he failed to disclose his holding as required by law for nearly a year. last october, he filed an updated statement of economic interest to include the stock, his only substantial investment.the cuccinelli campaign declined to answer questions about mr. williams and star scientific . chris lacivita, a strategist for the campaign, has said mr. cuccinelli did not realize his stock's value had passed,000, the threshold for reporting. once he did, he corrected the record. he has since sold all of his shares, his campaign has said, the last in mid-april .",139
politics,"washington — national health spending climbed to.7 trillion in, or an average of,700 for every person in the country, but as a share of the economy, it remained stable for the third consecutive year, the obama administration said monday.the rate of increase in health spending, 3.9 percent in, was the same as in 2009 and 2010 — the lowest annual rates recorded in the 52 years the government has been collecting such data. federal officials could not say for sure whether the low growth in health spending represented the start of a trend or reflected the continuing effects of the recession, which crimped the economy from december 2007 to june. kathleen sebelius, the secretary of health and human services, said that ""the statistics show how the affordable care act is already making a difference,"" saving money for consumers . but a report issued by the centers for medicare and medicaid services, in her department, said that the law had so far had ""no discernible impact"" on overall health spending .although some provisions of the law have taken effect, the report said, ""their influence on overall health spending through 2011 was minimal.""the recession increased unemployment, reduced the number of people with private health insurance, lowered household income and assets and therefore tended to slow health spending, said micah b. hartman, a statistician at the centers for medicare and medicaid services .in the report, federal officials said that total national spending on prescription drugs and doctors' services grew faster in 2011 than in the year before, but that spending on hospital care grew more slowly. medicaid spending likewise grew less quickly in 2011 than in the prior year, as states struggled with budget problems. but medicare spending grew more rapidly, because of an increase in ""the volume and intensity"" of doctors' services and a one-time increase in medicare payments to skilled nursing homes, said the report, published in the journal health affairs. national health spending grew at roughly the same pace as the overall economy, without adjusting for inflation, so its share of the economy stayed the same, at.9 percent in, where it has been since. by contrast, health spending accounted for just.8 percent of the economy in. health spending grew more than 5 percent each year from 1961 to. it rose at double-digit rates in some years, including every year from 1966 to 1984 and from 1988 to.the report did not forecast the effects of the new health care law on future spending . some provisions of the law, including subsidized insurance for millions of americans, could increase spending, officials said. but the law also trims medicare payments to many health care providers and authorizes experiments to slow the growth of health spending .""the jury is still out whether all the innovations we're testing will have much impact,"" said richard s. foster, who supervised the preparation of the report as chief actuary of the medicare agency. ""i am optimistic. there's a lot of potential. more and more health care providers understand that the future cannot be like the past, in which health spending almost always grew faster than the gross domestic product .""evidence of the new emphasis can be seen in a series of articles published in the archives of internal medicine, now known as jama internal medicine, under the title ""less is more."" the series highlights cases in which ""the overuse of medical care may result in harm and in which less care is likely to result in better health."" total spending for doctors' services rose.6 percent in, to $436 billion, while spending for hospital care increased.3 percent, to.6 billion. spending on prescription drugs at retail stores reached $263 billion in, up.9 percent from, when growth was just four-tenths of 1 percent. the latest increase was still well below the average increase of.8 percent a year from 2000 to. federal officials said the increase in 2011 resulted partly from rapid growth in prices for brand-name drugs.prices for specialty drugs, typically prescribed by medical specialists for chronic conditions, have increased at double-digit rates in recent years, the government said. in addition, spending on new brand-name drugs — those brought to market in the previous two years — more than doubled from 2010 to, driven by an increase in the number of new medicines .""in,"" the report said, "" spending for private health insurance premiums increased.8 percent, as did spending for benefits . out-of-pocket spending by consumers increased.8 percent in, accelerating from.1 percent in 2010 but still slower than the average annual growth rate of.7 percent"" from 2002 to.",190
politics,"philadelphia — a state judge ruled on monday that a senior catholic official who was sent to prison for his role in a sexual abuse scandal should be released on bail after his conviction for child endangerment was overturned.msgr. william j. lynn, the first senior official of the roman catholic church to be convicted in connection with charges of sexual abuse of children by priests, was granted bail on monday by judge m. teresa sarmina of common pleas court . bail was set at,000, of which monsignor lynn must pay,000 up front. judge sarmina also ordered him to surrender his passport, wear an electronic ankle bracelet and report weekly to law enforcement officials .monsignor lynn, 62, who was not accused of personally abusing children, was convicted in june 2012 on one count of violating a child welfare law by allowing another priest, edward v. avery, to live in church buildings where he abused a boy.as secretary for clergy in the philadelphia archdiocese, monsignor lynn was responsible for investigating claims of sexual abuse by priests. prosecutors claimed at his trial that he had put the reputation of the church ahead of the protection of children, a view supported last week by the appeals court .in reversing the conviction, the pennsylvania superior court ruled that prosecutors had provided ""more than adequate"" evidence that monsignor lynn ""prioritized the archdiocese's reputation over the safety of potential victims of sexually abusive priests."" but it rejected the argument, accepted at the trial, that the child welfare law applied to a ""parent, guardian or other person supervising the welfare of a child"" could be used to prosecute monsignor lynn.monsignor lynn has served about 18 months of a three- to six-year prison sentence . his lawyer, thomas bergstrom, said he was expected to be freed on thursday or friday. he was granted bail pending an appeal to the state supreme court by the philadelphia district attorney's office, which must be filed by late january. defense lawyers argued during the trial that monsignor lynn was not properly charged under the original version of the child welfare law, which applied only to direct caretakers like parents or guardians. the law was updated to cover supervisors in, after the monsignor left his post. judge sarmina, who presided over monsignor lynn's trial, said on monday that she had given the case careful consideration in light of the appeals court's ruling . ""i may have got it wrong,"" she said in a statement at the start of the bail hearing . ""after all, i'm fallible. if the conviction is in question, is not the punishment in question?""hugh burns, the head of the appeals unit at the philadelphia district attorney's office, opposed bail, arguing that the superior court's ruling could be reversed and that it was unusual for defendants convicted of felonies to be freed while their cases are under appeal. district attorney r. seth williams said he was ""disgusted"" by the superior court ruling . "" judge sarmina was correct when she said that monsignor lynn enabled monsters in clerical garb to destroy the souls of children,"" mr. williams said.he said the trial verdict was ""legally sound,"" and he accused the superior court of failing to follow a 1976 ruling by the pennsylvania supreme court that the law under which monsignor lynn was convicted was to be applied for ""broad protective purposes.""the survivors network of those abused by priests said it was disappointed by the bail decision and urged the state supreme court to reinstate the conviction.judy miller, who leads the group's delaware chapter, urged the archdiocese not to reinstate monsignor lynn. ms. miller handed out pamphlets containing the group's demands to catholics emerging from a sunday morning mass at the cathedral basilica of ss. peter and paul in central philadelphia .""monsignor lynn represents thousands of catholic officials across this country and around the world who have knowingly endangered children,"" ms. miller said. ""they have protected criminals and their reputation, and not protected children that were placed in their care.""kenneth gavin, a spokesman for the archdiocese, declined to say whether monsignor lynn could return to ministry.""it's too early in the process to comment definitively about a possible assignment in active ministry,"" mr. gavin wrote in an email.",281
arts,"tim jenison has always thought of himself as an inventor, the kind of person who keeps a running list of practical puzzles for when he can devote spare brain cells to solving them.""when i discover that someone else has already done it, it's a huge relief, because i can take it off that to-do list,"" mr. jenison, a successful san antonio entrepreneur whose innovations usually take the form of video equipment, said recently.""but ideas pop up at the weirdest time,"" he added. ""who knows why our subconscious does what it does?""for reasons he cannot quite explain, mr. jenison hit upon a technological sleight of hand, using optical gadgetry that has been available for centuries, that he believed could have aided the work of the old master painters — particularly johannes vermeer, the 17th-century dutchman with a startling talent for photorealistic work.finding no literature that he felt proved or disproved his thesis, mr. jenison determined he had only one course of action: use his discoveries to recreate a vermeer work, despite his lack of painting experience.mr. jenison's four-year journey to produce his own version of ""the music lesson"" is chronicled in ""tim's vermeer,"" a documentary film that sony pictures classics will open in limited release on dec. 6, and that was created by the illusionist duo of penn & teller.there is no trickery, they say, in ""tim's vermeer,"" which follows mr. jenison through his labors at his san antonio warehouse, and on trips to delft, in the netherlands, where vermeer painted, and to buckingham palace, where ""the music lesson"" is kept.mr. jenison's project and the resulting film revisit a longstanding debate about how vermeer and his contemporaries created their paintings, full of stunning optical details seemingly too precise for the naked eye to capture: would lenses, mirrors and the camera obscura have been known to these artists, and did they use them in their work?the documentary also implicitly asks the questions: what makes a work of art? who can be called an artist? can quantifiable science take the place of creativity, or are they synonymous?while scholars are not totally convinced by some of the ideas that ""tim's vermeer"" advances, some art experts who have seen the film say that they nonetheless admire mr. jenison for the seriousness he applies to his pursuit and the painting he ultimately produces.""it's kind of breathtaking that he never did any painting before,"" said walter liedtke, curator of european paintings at the metropolitan museum of art, ""and he achieved something as good as he did.""mr. jenison, a soft-spoken engineer who can afford to chase his occasional flights of fancy, is the founder of newtek, a company that in the 1990s introduced a low-cost tv production device called the video toaster and now makes modern-day descendants like the tricaster.all that time spent contemplating colors and graphics led mr. jenison, around, to his first painterly innovation: with a fixed mirror, held at the right height and angle, he could copy the shapes and colors of images reflected in it. using this device, it took him about five hours to paint a convincing copy of a vintage photo of his father-in-law.if he combined this mirror device with a camera obscura, which projects images onto a wall or screen, mr. jenison reasoned, he could make sophisticated paintings of real-life scenes. as he thought about testing this process for, perhaps, a short youtube video or a scientific paper, he described it to penn jillette, who told him to stop what he was doing until a filmmaking team could be put in place.""i drove tim kind of crazy,"" said mr. jillette, who is a producer of ""tim's vermeer."" ""i took tim at his peak excitement and shut him down for two months, and then made him go back to it.""teller, the traditionally silent partner of penn & teller and the director of ""tim's vermeer,"" said he approached the film as he might a stage illusion.each step in mr. jenison's process as he constructs the scene depicted in ""the music lesson"" in his warehouse — building and arranging the furniture and instruments, fabricating costumes and placing the models, making his own lens and pigments — needed to be explained to an audience before his act of painting could pay off.""i'm fascinated by a guy who will embrace such an extraordinarily strange thing, to the degree that he will allow it to completely upset his life for four years,"" teller said.during the 130 days he spent painting (following the 213 days needed to build the tableau, mr. jenison encountered several unexpected obstacles, whether the discovery that his camera obscura did not produce images that were bright or clear enough for him to paint (this was solved by adding a curved mirror to the setup, or the tediousness of his painstaking task.at times, mr. jenison said, he might have given up had there not been a film crew recording his every brush stroke. ""it was sort of getting old,"" he said. ""it was kind of a full-time job.""",194
science,"buckets of blickets: children and logic: a game developed by researchers at the university of california, berkeley, hopes to show how imaginative play in children may influence development of abstract thought.other species play, but none play for as much of their lives as humans do, or as imaginatively, or with as much protection from the family circle. human children are unique in using play to explore hypothetical situations rather than to rehearse actual challenges they'll face later. kittens may pretend to be cats fighting, but they will not pretend to be children; children, by contrast, will readily pretend to be cats or kittens — and then to be hannah montana, followed by spider-man saving the day.and in doing so, they develop some of humanity's most consequential faculties. they learn the art, pleasure and power of hypothesis — of imagining new possibilities. and serious students of play believe that this helps make the species great.the idea that play contributes to human success goes back at least a century. but in the last 25 years or so, researchers like elizabeth s. spelke, brian sutton-smith, jaak panksepp and alison gopnik have developed this notion more richly and tied it more closely to both neuroscience and human evolution. they see play as essential not just to individual development, but to humanity's unusual ability to inhabit, exploit and change the environment.dr. gopnik, author of ""the scientist in the crib"" and ""the philosophical baby,"" and a professor of psychology at the university of california, berkeley, has been studying the ways that children learn to assess their environment through play. lately she has focused on the distinction between ""exploring"" new environments and ""exploiting"" them. when we're quite young, we are more willing to explore, she finds; adults are more inclined to exploit.to exploit, one leans heavily on lessons (and often unconscious rules) learned earlier — so-called prior biases. these biases are useful to adults because they save time and reduce error: by going to the restaurant you know is good, instead of the new place across town, you increase the chance that you'll enjoy the evening.most adults are slow to set such biases aside; young children fling them away like bad fruit.dr. gopnik shows this brilliantly with a game she invented with the psychologist david sobel (her student, now a professor at brown. in the game, which has the fetching name blickets, players try to figure out what it is that makes an otherwise undistinguished clay figure a blicket. in some scenarios you can win even if you're applying a prior bias. in others you can't.last summer i joined dr. gopnik behind a wall of one-way glass to watch her lab manager, sophie bridgers, play the game with an extremely alert 5-year-old, esther.seated at a child-size table, esther leaned forward on her elbows to watch as ms. bridgers brought out a small bin of clay shapes and told her that some of them were blickets but most were not.""you cannot tell which ones are blickets by looking at them. but the ones that are blickets have blicketness inside. and luckily,"" ms. bridgers went on, holding up a box with a red plastic top, ""i have my machine. blicketness makes my machine turn on and play music .""it's a ruse, of course. the box responds not to the clay shapes but to a switch under the table controlled by ms. bridgers.now came the challenge. this version of the blicket game, which gopnik developed in collaboration with berkeley colleagues christopher lucas and tom griffiths, can be played by either of two rules, called ""and"" and ""or."" the ""or"" version is easier: when a blicket is placed atop the machine, it will light the machine up whether placed there by itself or with other pieces. it is either a blicket or it isn't; it doesn't depend on the presence of any other object.in the ""and"" trial, however, a blicket reveals its blicketness only if both it and another blicket are placed on the machine; and it will light up the box even if it and the other blicket are accompanied by a non-blicket. it can be harder than it sounds, and this is the game that esther played.first, ms. bridgers put each of three clay shapes on the box individually — rectangle, then triangle, then a bridge. none activated the machine. then she put them on the box in three successive combinations.2. rectangle and bridge: machine lighted up and played a tune!ms. bridgers then picked up each piece in turn and asked esther whether it was a blicket. i had been indulging my adult (and journalistic) prior bias for recorded observation by filling several pages with notes and diagrams, and i started flipping frantically through my notebook.",177

two fewer than murray .if he needed to issue a statement of intent to counter the home hysteria, which went up a notch on saturday when british teenager laura robson also reached the last, djokovic did it.""it was a fantastic match. i felt great from the start until the end,"" the six- times grand slam champion, who faces 13th-seeded german veteran tommy haas next, told a news conference .""i enjoyed every moment of it. when you play that well you feel great, you feel confident .""this kind of performance came at the right time for me. i'm going to expect tough challenges in front of me but i'm ready.""with murray enjoying a day of leisure - apart from a brief appearance on centre court as part of a celebration of some of britain's olympians from london 2012 - robson kept the home pot bubbling when she came back from the brink to beat new zealander marina erakovic, prompting resounding cheers around the grounds. robson, a former junior champion, won 1-6 7-5 6-3 to become the first british woman to reach the fourth round for 15 years.victory over unseeded estonian kaia kanepi would put her on collision course with five- times champion williams who stretched her winning streak to 34 when demolishing date-krumm . williams walked on court stoney-faced and said she had been slightly puzzled by the scheduling.""i was a little surprised i was playing third after two men's matches,"" the 31-year-old, who has dropped only 11 games to reach the fourth round, said.her patience was rewarded with her first night outing under the wimbledon roof which slid shut to allow its lighting system to illuminate her latest dazzling display.""i love the atmosphere. i love the sound that the ball makes,"" she said. ""it just feels really cool.""with wimbledon sticking to its tradition of having no play on the middle sunday, monday promises to be hectic with a total of 16 men's and women's singles matches across the courts . murray will take centre stage when he takes on russian 20th seed mikhail youznhy for a place in the quarter-finals . youzhny loomed onto the scott's radar with a straightforward victory over serbia's viktor troicki and afterwards shrugged off the prospect of facing a home favourite in his own backyard.""don't worry, i will sleep normal,"" he said.",246

business,"campaigns for web sites that offer lodging reservations usually feature colorful characters, perhaps to counter the prosaic, transactional nature of e-commerce. among them are the roaming gnome, for travelocity; the negotiator, played by william shatner, for priceline; hordes of animated travelers, for hotels .com; and a man in a crash helmet delivering price assurance checks, for orbitz.a competitive web site is taking a decidedly different tack as it begins its first image campaign, as part of efforts to raise its brand's profile among american travelers. the campaign, which is to start on tuesday, promotes booking.com, a unit of the priceline group that operates separately from priceline.the booking.com campaign, with an initial budget estimated at more than $35 million, will include commercials on television and in movie theaters as well as ads online . the campaign is being created by the amsterdam office of wieden & kennedy, which was chosen after an unpublicized review that also included agencies based in cities like new york and san francisco .the priceline group classifies booking.com, founded in, as one of its international brands, along with agoda.com and rentalcars.com. booking.com, based in amsterdam, has been offering accommodations at american hotels, motels and resorts for the last six years, said paul j. hennessy, chief marketing officer at booking.com.""it's time for our coming-out party,"" mr. hennessy said in an interview on friday in midtown manhattan as he offered a preview of the campaign. ""the u.s. is one of the largest travel markets in the world and we see great potential there.""it is also one of the most competitive travel markets, mr. hennessy acknowledged. but, he said, he believes there is an opening for booking.com because the lodging web sites that are familiar to americans have ""commoditized the market "" by ""all pounding the same message of low-price guarantees and best prices.""""american customers are ready for a new hero, if you will,"" mr. hennessy said, ""and booking.com could be that hero.""to underline that, the campaign will celebrate what mark bernath, the executive creative director at wieden & kennedy amsterdam who joined mr. hennessy for the interview, called ""the delight of right"" — that is, the potential moment of truth when a traveler who booked a room online "" opens the door and has a first look"" and is pleased or relieved, rather than dismayed or disgusted, by what he or she finds inside.""the pressure on the booker can be quite intense,"" mr. bernath said, ""so anyone who puts the best tools into your hands"" to produce a positive outcome will be perceived ""as a good partner to have.""that is perhaps more relevant in the united states than in europe, said mr. bernath, an american who has worked at wieden & kennedy amsterdam since.""the plight of the american traveler,"" mr. bernath said, is that the number of days of vacation ""is less than in europe.""as a result, ""it's more crucial, if you have two weeks instead of four or five, to nail it,"" he added, when booking accommodations.that is brought to life in the 60-second commercial that will serve to introduce the campaign. the spot takes a tongue-in-cheek approach, presenting a family of five on vacation in the dramatic way that nfl films covers a super bowl .""this vacation has been a year in the planning,"" a stentorian narrator says as the family walks, in slow motion, down a hotel hallway, and ""hinges on"" the reaction to the room.""the door opens,"" the narrator says. ""you hold your breath. and then you realize, you got it right. you got it booking right.""the narrator encourages travelers to ""bask in the booking glory"" and concludes: ""booking.com. booking.yeah; he pronounces the latter ""booking-dot-yeah."" the phrase ""booking.yeah"" appears on screen along with the theme of the campaign, ""planet earth's no. 1 accommodation site.""using the brand name as an adjective and rendering it as ""booking.yeah"" is an example of a marketing tactic known as nameonics, which ties a brand name to a product quality or benefit. other examples include ""zestfully clean,"" for zest soap; ""krogering,"" for the kroger supermarket chain ; and, in a campaign created last summer by wieden & kennedy amsterdam, "" power through,"" for powerade sports beverages.""in a lot of advertising in the category, there are beautiful places, beautiful people,"" mr. hennessy said, ""or just giving you a number,"" referring to the price of the room being booked, ""but no connection to the brand.""by contrast, the brand is an intrinsic part of the booking.com campaign, he added.other, shorter commercials will make similar points. one spot, which shows two gleeful women bumping chests, declares, ""behold the power of a well-booked accommodation.""in another spot, which asserts that ""when you get it right,"" ""you'll never want to leave,"" a man is depicted having to drag a woman from their room to get her to check out.and a spot about using booking.com on mobile devices promises that the web site means ""the odds are in your favor,"" in a moment that seems to mash up "" the hunger games "" and ""national lampoon's vacation.""the media buying for the campaign is being handled by the new york office of wieden & kennedy . as the campaign runs in the united states, mr. hennessy said, executives at booking.com will ""see how it resonates and see how customers react to it.""based on that reaction, the ads could be expanded into markets like europe, he added, where booking.com is far better known.",240
business,"washington — the number of americans who signed contracts to buy existing homes in november was nearly unchanged from october, suggesting sales are stabilizing after several months of declines. the national association of realtors said on monday that its seasonally adjusted index for pending home sales ticked up to.7 from.5 in october. the october figure was revised lower from an initial reading of.1. higher mortgage rates and strong price gains over the last two years have slowed sales. the pending home sales index had fallen for five straight months before november. completed sales of existing homes fell for three straight months, the association said earlier this month .there is generally a one- to two-month lag from a signed contract to a completed sale.the average interest rate on a 30-year mortgage edged higher to.48 percent last week, from.47 percent the previous week . mortgage rates jumped about.25 percentage points from may through september, peaking at.6 percent, after the federal reserve's chairman, ben s. bernanke, indicated in the spring that the fed would start to scale back its economic stimulus program before the end of the year. earlier this month, the fed announced it would reduce its $85 billion in monthly purchases of treasury and mortgage-backed securities by $10 billion a month starting in january. the bond purchases are intended to hold down longer-term interest rates and encourage more borrowing and spending .robert kavcic, an economist at bmo capital markets, said that recent housing market indicators had been mixed. applications for mortgages to purchase homes fell to a nearly two-year low last week, he said.still, mr. kavcic said, ""we continue to believe that the u.s. housing market will absorb the upward move in mortgage rates and push higher in, helped by still-attractive affordability, better job growth and improved confidence in the recovery .""despite the recent declines, sales of existing homes should reach.1 million in, the highest total in seven years, the association forecast . that is 10 percent higher than 2012's total of almost.7 million . but it is still below the.5 million that is consistent with a healthy housing market .the association forecast that sales would remain largely flat in 2014 and then rise to.3 million in. steady job gains should make it easier for more people to buy homes. and mortgage rates remain low by historical standards . signed contracts for existing homes rose in the south and west last month, while falling in the northeast and midwest.",274
politics,"washington — prospects for passage of a new farm bill before the end of the year appear dim, with just a week left before congress adjourns for the holidays, although lawmakers insisted they were close to a deal.the current measure expires at the end of the month. members of the house and senate have been meeting to reconcile their different versions of a new bill, and they agree on many things, including expanding crop insurance for farmers . but they remain far apart on issues like cuts to the food stamp program . a house proposal would cut about $40 billion from the program, while a senate version would trim roughly.5 billion, mainly by making administrative changes.despite the differences, senator debbie stabenow, democrat of michigan and chairwoman of the senate agriculture committee, and representative frank d. lucas, republican of oklahoma, who heads the house agriculture committee, say they have made significant gains in trying to work out a deal that would pass both houses.""chairman lucas and i are working in good faith to produce a conference report that's good for farmers, ranchers and families,"" ms. stabenow said.the two lawmakers differ on what to do if they cannot get a deal in place before congress leaves. mr. lucas has proposed extending the current farm bill, first passed in 2008 and extended last year, through january. he said in a statement that it would be the ""responsible thing to do given our tight deadline.""the house leadership has signaled that it is open to an extension, but senator harry reid, the majority leader, and ms. stabenow said they are opposed.ms. stabenow said an extension could allow direct payments, which are made to farmers and farmland owners who may or may not grow crops, to continue for another year. the much-criticized program costs about $5 billion a year, and both the house and the senate farm bills would eliminate it.ms. stabenow said she would like the house to remain in session for another week until a deal on the farm bill can be reached.the most immediate impact of the expiration of the current farm bill would be on milk prices. without congressional action, the government would have to follow a 1949 farm law that would force the federal government to buy milk at wildly inflated prices, which would mean higher prices for consumers . the agriculture department said a jump in milk prices could be avoided if a new farm bill is in place sometime in january. farm groups said that despite the lack of a new farm bill this year they were encouraged by the progress.""we would have loved to have it done by the end of the year, but if they can get something done in early january, we would be appreciative,"" said dale moore, executive director for public policy at the american farm bureau federation, the country's largest farm organization.",447

sports,"gullane, scotland — some of the most significant moments in recent history of the british open at muirfield have come on the 17th hole. ernie els recovered from a mini-collapse with a birdie that put him into a playoff he won in. jack nicklaus took the outright lead in 1966 by reaching the par 5 in two shots for a birdie that carried him to his first claret jug . it's where lee trevino chipped in for par, which ultimately denied nicklaus a shot at the third leg of the grand slam and demoralized tony jacklin.but it's not just muirfield .the closing holes, with the exception of st . andrews and newly configured royal liverpool, are so tough that opens often are won with a par. it's the penultimate hole that has decided so many championships over the years. and because the 17th hole presents a birdie chance, it could become pivotal on sunday.here are five key moments from the 17th hole in the british open :nothing ever came easily for padraig harrington in his two open titles, even though he won his second straight in 2008 at royal birkdale by four shots.first, the irishman had to rally past 53-year-old greg norman, which he did on the 12th hole when norman missed a par putt . then it was ian poulter making a late run and getting into the clubhouse at 7-over, which looked like it might be enough to at least force a playoff, given the wind-swept conditions off the lancashire coast.harrington had a two-shot lead standing in the 17th fairway when he played a 5-wood that bounded onto the green and up the ridge to the back pin, finally settling some 4 feet away for an eagle that gave him a four-shot lead and wrapped up the title .""it's one of the few times i think i've ever heard my caddie say, 'good shot,' to me before the ball is finished,"" harrington said.nick price had reason to believe he wasn't meant to have his name on the claret jug . he lost a three-shot lead with six holes to play in 1982 at royal troon as tom watson won his fourth british open . he finished one shot behind seve ballesteros in 1988 at royal lytham. and late sunday afternoon at turnberry in, price was two shots behind jesper parnevik and running out of holes.he got some help from the swede when parnevik didn't bother looking at the scoreboard and, thinking he needed birdie on the 18th, attacked the flag and made bogey. along with not knowing the score, parnevik didn't interpret the cheer.behind him on the 17th, price rolled a 50-foot eagle putt toward the hole, stomping his foot to urge it toward the cup, and galloping toward the hole when it dropped for an eagle. in a remarkable turnaround, price went from a two-shot deficit to a one-shot lead, and he made par on the 18th to win the coveted jug.carnoustie in 1999 is best remembered from the follies of jean van de velde, who had a three-shot lead playing the 18th hole and had to make an 8-foot par putt for a triple bogey to get into a playoff. but there were great shots that followed that were worth remembering, none more important than paul lawrie at the par-4 17th.lawrie wound up setting a major championship record by coming from 10 shots behind on the final day to win — with loads of help from van de velde, of course.the four- hole playoff among lawrie, van de velde and former open champion justin leonard turned on the 17th hole.both players opened with a pair of bogeys and were tied for the lead. lawrie then hit a 4-iron into 12 feet on the 17th for a birdie to take the lead. leonard hit into the barry burn on the 18th for the second time that day, and the open effectively was over when lawrie's 3-iron cleared the burn. that it ended up 3 feet for another birdie only changed the playoff score. the winning shot turned out to be that 4-iron on the 17th, and scotland had its first open champion on a scottish links in 68 years.one shot by lee trevino changed the fortunes of two players in 1972 at muirfield . lee trevino was going for his second straight open, and he needed his full bag of tricks, chipping in three times during the week. the turning point came on the 17th hole. jack nicklaus, going for the third leg of the grand slam, was six shots behind going into the last day and closed with a 66 to get into the clubhouse at 5-under. behind him were trevino and jacklin, who were tied for the lead at 6 under on the par. trevino was in big trouble. his fourth shot went through the back of the green, up a slope of mild rough. jacklin had a 20- foot birdie putt, and looked like he would at least have a one-shot lead playing the final hole .playing quickly, trevino chipped in for a par. nicklaus in the scoring area couldn't believe what he heard. and it must have rattled jacklin, for he not only missed his birdie putt, but he pulled the 3- footer for par to fall

business,"in december, the federal aviation administration allowed airbus, the european plane maker, to use 14-ounce lithium-ion batteries to provide standby power for the emergency lighting system of its new a380 jumbo jet .ten months later, the agency allowed boeing to use the same volatile type of battery on its new 787 plane. but in boeing's case, the batteries weighed 63 pounds each, were to be used in critical flight systems as well as to provide backup power, and would be charged and discharged much more often. yet the agency's ruling used identical language — it could have been just cut and pasted — in laying out the broad safeguards for using the batteries that it had given airbus to follow.the use of lithium batteries in the 787 is at the center of the difficulties involving boeing. the plane maker has staked its reputation on the success of the, an aircraft it nicknamed the dreamliner. all 50 787s delivered to airlines worldwide were grounded last week until investigators in the united states and japan find out why two lithium batteries failed in recent weeks, causing a fire on one 787 and damage to another that led to an emergency landing .it also raises fundamental questions about how federal regulators certify new technology and how they balance advances in airplane design and engineering with ensuring safety in commercial flying. in addition to finding out what went wrong, these issues will be examined in a federal investigation and at future senate hearings.when it approved boeing's request in, the f.a.a. said it had limited experience with the use of lithium-ion batteries in commercial airplanes, though it acknowledged that the batteries themselves were more prone to fire than traditional nickel-cadmium or lead-acid batteries .still, the agency approved the technology on the assumption that boeing could make the batteries work and that computer controls could prevent batteries from overcharging or overheating. the agency also specified that any fire or toxic leak be contained and not damage any surrounding electrical systems .at the same time, the agency brushed off concerns raised in 2006 and 2007 by the air line pilots association that a fire in flight would be difficult to extinguish and that flight crews should be given extra training.""we have concluded that providing a means for controlling or extinguishing a fire — such as stopping the flow of fluids, shutting down equipment, or fireproof equipment"" was an ""adequate alternative to requiring the flight or cabin crew to use extinguishing agents,"" the agency said in its 2006 decision about the airbus a.experts said that regardless of the cause of the 787's problems, the charred remains of the battery that caught fire earlier this month in a plane in boston raised the question of whether the safeguards functioned properly.on wednesday, the national transportation safety board, which is investigating the battery fire in boston, said that all eight cells in the battery had sustained "" varying degrees of thermal damage."" six of them have been scanned and disassembled for further examination.many battery experts said they viewed boeing's decision to use lithium-ion batteries as a reasonable one and pointed out that lithium-ion batteries had also been used in expensive space satellites since around 2000 without serious problems. they said that track record would have added to the confidence boeing and federal regulators had about using them in commercial airliners.jay f. whitacre, an associate professor of engineering at carnegie mellon university, said gs yuasa, the japanese company that built the 787 batteries, told the national aeronautics and space administration in a 2008 presentation that it had already supplied batteries for six satellites and had contracts for 50 more. gs yuasa also said that its satellite batteries had never had a shorting incident in more than 10 years of production.""that's pretty compelling,"" professor whitacre said. ""if i had all that data and saw that they were making batteries for 50 more satellites, i'd say that was a reasonable risk to take. my sense is that boeing did a fairly decent job of picking the right company .""but another battery expert, donald sadoway, a materials chemistry professor at m.i.t., disagreed. he said that sticking with an older type of battery instead of the lighter lithium battery would not have made a huge difference to the, adding about 40 pounds, or the equivalent of an extra suitcase per battery .""so you will risk the plane for something that's tantamount to one guy's suitcase?"" mr. sadoway said. ""who's making the calculation here? it's absurd. it doesn't add up.""with plane makers pushing the envelope on new technology, safety experts have questioned whether federal regulators had the expertise or the manpower to properly oversee those developments.",93
business,"london — the developers of a major natural gas field in azerbaijan have decided that the western end of their export pipeline to europe should take a shorter, southern route ending in italy rather than a northern one to austria, one of the companies competing for the pipeline business said wednesday.the austrian energy company omv, the lead shareholder in the company vying for the northern route, said it had been informed it would not win the pipeline deal, which by some estimates was to cost $4 billion.the formal announcement, which was expected to be made in azerbaijan on friday, is likely to favor a project called the trans adriatic pipeline, which would run about 900 kilometers, or 560 miles, through greece and albania, ending in southern italy. the austrian route would have been about,300 kilometers long.the winning route will convey gas to europe through a connection to a new pipeline planned to run through turkey that links back to the azeri field through georgia .a spokesman for the assumed winner, the trans adriatic pipeline group, which is based in baar, switzerland, declined to comment wednesday.the reasons for the decision by the gas field's developer, the shah deniz ii group, were not disclosed on wednesday. the group includes socar, the azerbaijani national oil company ; bp of britain; statoil of norway; and total of france.the decision to go with a south european route is a milestone in a long effort by azerbaijan and its partners — particularly bp, the field operator — to bring gas from the huge reserves beneath the caspian sea directly to europe in competition with russia. although azerbaijan's role as a supplier to europe might be relatively small at first, it could grow as the country develops additional finds known to be beneath the caspian's floor.bp and other members of the shah deniz ii group are expected to take a 50 percent shareholding in the pipeline . shah deniz ii is a gas project in the caspian sea, off eastern azerbaijan, which along with its export pipelines is expected to cost more than $40 billion. the group has not made a final investment commitment to proceed with the project, though a decision is expected by the end of the year.a separate azeri field, the shah deniz i, is already producing and exporting gas to georgia and turkey .andrew neff, an analyst in moscow at the market research firm ihs in moscow, said that socar's agreeing last week to take a majority stake in the greek gas distributor desfa may have tipped the balance toward the trans adriatic pipeline . ''this gives azerbaijan a direct supply relationship with greece,'' he said.other factors may have included cost; gas demand in europe has been severely weakened by the continued economic doldrums. the longer pipeline to austria was expected to be somewhat costlier to build and operate than the route to italy.in addition, the consortium leaders may believe that italy and greece are better markets for gas than countries like bulgaria and hungary.but italy, for one, is oversupplied with gas and has been trying to trim imports from countries like algeria. the greek economy also appears to be a long way from recovery .the biggest loser in the deal is omv, which did the major research and planning for the northern-route consortium, called nabucco west, investing about?37 million, or $48 million, to date. the company considers its plan to transport azeri gas dead, according to an omv spokesman, johannes vetter. mr. vetter said the company was still hopeful, though, of using the work it had put into nabucco to help build pipelines to bring gas from offshore fields being developed off bulgaria.but the decision is a bitter blow to omv, as well as to countries along the nabucco route like bulgaria, hungary and romania that had hoped to tap into the line and profit from transit fees. they also hoped to reduce their energy dependence on russia.although bp has said that it wants a solution that benefits customers along both routes, with both pipelines eventually being completed, some analysts say the nabucco group might not be able to bounce back. ''they are now competing with everyone else,'' mr. neff said.whatever the route, the 10 billion cubic meters, or 353 billion cubic feet, of gas that is initially expected to come through the new pipeline each year would be small compared with the estimated 140 billion cubic meters of russian gas exports to europe.the russian gas giant gazprom is also planning a pipeline, called southstream, that would run from russia under the black sea and pass through bulgaria, serbia and croatia to wind up in northern italy.winners from the decision wednesday include statoil and a swiss company, axpo, which are large shareholders in the trans adriatic pipeline project. e.on, the big german utility, is also a shareholder.",54
business,"a big problem with the euro zone's one-size-fits-all monetary policy is that it risks fitting nobody. that, indeed, was a central cause of the crisis .early in the century, countries like spain and ireland were booming, while germany was in the doldrums. setting interest rates at a level that worked well for the euro zone on average had the effect of inflating the spanish and irish property bubbles while pushing wages up, so their economies became uncompetitive. when the bubbles burst, the damage was devastating.it would be hard to argue that any part of the euro zone is currently booming. even germany will eke out growth of only.3 percent this year, according to the international monetary fund . but it may not be long before the problems of a one-size-fits-all monetary policy are back to haunt the zone. even though the german economy is not growing strongly, it is still outperforming the average. what is more, labor is in short supply and house prices are rising at a moderate clip — a big contrast to the average among euro zone states, let alone recession -troubled countries such as italy. the european central bank's policy of keeping interest rates at the current level of.5 percent or lower for an ""extended period"" is right for the euro zone on average. the weaker countries would benefit from even looser monetary policy . germany, though, may already need something tighter. if the ""extended period"" of low interest rates goes on for years, it could experience a boom .many observers view one-size-fits-all interest rates as one of the zone's design defects, about which nothing can be done. others advocate policies — like full fiscal union — that are not going to be adopted and would not really hit the spot, even if they were. but the outlook is not quite so pessimistic. there are two policies that could considerably mitigate the damage of the common monetary policy — and they do not even require any treaty changes.the first is for euro zone members to pursue vigorous ""macroprudential"" policies. since lehman brothers went bust five years ago, it has become fashionable to call for bank regulators to have the tools to prevent future bubbles . the main idea is that they should be able to stop credit and asset prices from growing too fast by directly intervening in the way banks lend. one way of doing that would be to increase the minimum capital buffers banks have to hold if the economy is overheating; another would be to cut the size of mortgages they are allowed to make.such macroprudential policies are a good idea everywhere. but they are particularly important for the euro zone because individual countries cannot use interest rates or exchange rates to stop overheating. using macroprudential policy would not just restrain future booms; it would mean that a country's banking system would be better placed to weather the subsequent bust .the european union is gradually putting the necessary building blocks in place. one element of that effort is giving the regulatory authorities the job of conducting macroprudential policy. ten of the 28 e.u. members, including germany, had done so by july, while the rest were working on legislation.meanwhile, an e.u. law that sets out broadly the way macroprudential tools should be used comes into effect next year.within the euro zone rather than the wider european union, both the european central bank and the authorities in each country will have a say over the use of the antibubble tool kit. that is because, beginning next year, the e.c.b. will add bank supervision to its duty of running monetary policy . the basic principle is that the authorities in each country will be expected to take action, but if the e.c.b. believes they are not doing enough, it can use the tools, too.it has to be said, though, that both macroprudential policy and the way it would be organized within the euro zone are in their infancy. when it was used by spain during its housing bubble, it was not very effective. some observers say the whole policy is overrated; others say it just was not pursued vigorously enough. the best guess is that macroprudential policy would help if it were actively implemented but that it would be wrong to expect it to do the whole job of stopping an economy from overheating. that is why euro zone countries should adopt another approach as well: ""countercyclical"" fiscal policies .during the crisis, many countries have been forced to adopt austerity . that has been ""procyclical"" — exacerbating recessions in those countries . in some cases, like greece, that was unavoidable because their finances were in such a mess to start with.but in the future, countries should take exactly the opposite approach: running up fiscal surpluses in the good times and then allowing their budgets to go into deficit in the bad times. that is classic keynesianism, except that most keynesians forget the essential part about building up surpluses in booms. such an approach would not just restrain the booms; it would mean that countries would have the financial wherewithal to run expansionary fiscal policies during busts, rather than being forced into austerity .countercyclical fiscal policy is a good idea for all countries . but, as with macroprudential policy, it is particularly appropriate for the euro zone . it needs such tools to mitigate the defects of its one-size-fits-all monetary policy . before too long, some countries will need the courage to use them.hugo dixon is editor at large of reuters news .",432
science,"a jewelry store is an archive of the earth. every gem fixed to every ring or necklace was forged deep inside our planet, according to its own recipe of elements, temperature and pressure.but it has taken a while for geologists to decode the cookbook for gems. jade, for example, puzzled geologists for decades. ""for a long time people looked at this crazy rock, and it didn't make any sense,"" said george harlow, a geologist at the american museum of natural history . but thanks to the research of dr. harlow and other geologists, jade now has a back story: it formed in dying oceans.the discovery of gems like rubies and jade thus signifies more than just a new supply of bling in jewelry stores . it tells geologists some important things about the planet.if rocks contain jade, the scientists can be fairly sure those rocks are a vestige of an ocean buried underground. rubies, on the other hand, appear in places where mountains formed from continental collisions, even if those mountains were eroded away millions of years ago .gems may thus preserve precious clues to some of the most profound questions about the life of our planet.the earth is covered with tectonic plates. in some places, like off the coast of the northwestern united states, ocean plates are getting pushed underneath continental ones. as the plates sink, they are squeezed to titanic pressures. they also get cooked. under these extreme conditions, their atoms are combined into new molecular arrangements that would never emerge anywhere else on earth. hot jets of mineral-rich fluid rise from the plates, pushing up into the overlying rock. among the things that emerge from that fluid is a mixture of sodium, aluminum, silicon and oxygen known as jadeite — a form of jade.in the current issue of the journal earth and planetary science letters, dr. harlow and his colleagues report new findings that support this chain of events . at the bottom of the caribbean sea, they found jade-bearing deposits that are 30 million years older than the surrounding rock. that's what you would expect if jade-producing fluid rose up from sinking oceanic crust long before other material from a sinking ocean plate.in the journal geology, dr. harlow — writing with robert j. stern of the university of texas at dallas, tatsuki tsujimori of okayama university in japan and lee a. groat of the university of british columbia — explores some stories that gems like jade can tell. each is different. while jade is produced from dying oceans, for example, rubies are forged in newborn mountains.some mountain ranges, like the himalayas, were formed when two continental plates collided. fifty million years ago, the indian subcontinent was an isolated island. in a slow-motion crash, it plowed into asia . the force of the impact crumpled rocks for hundreds of miles inland, producing mountains.as mountains rose overhead, the indian plate slid underneath asia . once again, the rock was squeezed and heated. continents are ringed by rocks like shale, formed from sediments washing off of land. when crushed in this subterranean forge, shale can produce crystals of aluminum and oxygen.if these crystals stop developing, they become sapphires. but the crystals may instead get pushed up toward the surface of the earth. the overlying rock they move into is rich in chromium. the chromium atoms push the aluminum atoms out of the crystals and take their place, giving them a red color. ""when they get a little chromium in them, we call them rubies,"" dr. stern said.the oldest deposits of jade and rubies date to only about 600 million years ago . the earth itself is more than.5 billion years old, which naturally raises the question of why there aren't any jade stones or rubies from the first nearly four billion years of the planet's existence.dr. stern, for one, thinks the answer is that plate tectonics — the stirring of the planet's interior that drives plates around its surface — didn't exist for most of earth's history. ""i would say it started less than a billion years ago,"" he said.that's a controversial idea in the geological community. perhaps gems may someday resolve it.",289
sports,"san diego — there is a shop in the village of la jolla, second act west, where people flock to find vintage clothing. seven miles away, tiger woods rooted around in the past on monday and dug up his designer game from a few years back, turning torrey pines into his second act, west .in winning his pga tour season debut for the first time since, woods was equal parts technician and trick-shot artist. torrey pines, the site of 8 of his 75 tour victories, is where woods's imagination takes flight, as was made plain down the stretch of his closing, which propelled him to a four- stroke victory in the farmers insurance open over the defending champion, brandt snedeker, and josh teater. woods now stands seven victories behind sam snead's record.""does it feel good?"" woods said. ""yes. does it give me confidence? absolutely. this is a nice way to start the year."" woods, who finished at 14-under, was ahead by eight strokes with five holes left. on a brisk, windy day marked by snail-like play because of the fog -delayed shotgun finish, woods lost his concentration and his accuracy off the tee but never his lead, which was four at the conclusion of sunday afternoon's third round.""i started to lose my patience out there a little bit with the slow play,"" woods said, ""and that's when i made a few mistakes.""not that he was worried. ""i had an eight-stroke lead,"" he said. ""so i just needed to stay upright and i was going to be fine."" woods, 37, has won this tournament seven times. after five of his previous six titles, he has gone on to win at least one major.does woods have his aura back? ""i won this tournament by four shots, so that's something i'm proud of,"" he said, adding, ""i would like to win eight, nine times a year.""it took woods's threesome nearly four hours to complete its final 11 holes. until the wind and the waiting wore him down, woods's play harked back to his performance here during his injury-shortened season in, when he won his sixth tournament title with a record eight- stroke victory against ryuji imada. five months later, he won the united states open on the same course.as was the case in woods's glory days, he pulled away from the pack on the par 5s. snedeker played the par 5s in minus. woods played the same holes in minus, which was reason enough for him to smile despite his finish: bogey, double bogey, par, bogey, par.""pretty much did everything well this week and built myself a nice little cushion,"" woods said. ""i had some mistakes at the end, but all my good play before that really allowed me to afford those mistakes.""if there was a single shot monday that signaled that the woods of old was back, it was his second on the par-5 ninth .on the tee box, woods backed off his ball after hearing the click of a camera, a common sound in any woods gallery but particularly so on this day, when the gates were opened to the nonpaying public.after glaring at the offending photographer, woods set up again for his shot and blocked the ball with a swing so loose his driver flew out of his hands. ""thank you,"" he said in a comment directed at the photographer, who had wisely moved on.""it was not a good time to do that,"" woods said later.he was still steaming as he walked off the tee, muttering an expletive under his breath as he walked toward his ball, which was right of the cart path, in a fenced-off area near a temporary tournament tent.after receiving a free drop, woods took his 3-iron and hit a 217-yard cut shot that landed on the fairway, 85 yards from the pin. he hit onto the green and two-putted for a par that was routine only in his world.when he arrived at no. 15, a 480- yard par, woods was seven strokes ahead of snedeker, the leader in the clubhouse. he hit his drive into a hazard to the left to set up a two-putt from 13 feet for a double bogey . woods hit five fairways in his fourth round after finding 12 of 14 in his second. in his best years, woods was never the straightest off the tee. his genius was evident in his recovery shots, like the one he hit out of the bunker on the par-3 11th that curled to within inches of the cup.""my short game was back to how i know it can be,"" woods said.he added, ""that allowed me to save some pars, save some birdies and move my way up the board .""the resumption of the fourth round at:10 a.m. local time prevented any of the tour rookies who did not finish sunday from taking part in the monday qualifying for this week's event, the waste management phoenix open.among those affected was brad fritsch, who began the fourth round in second place and needed to finish in the top 10 to earn a place in this week's field. playing in the group directly ahead of woods, he got off to a spectacular start, sticking his tee shot at the par-3 eighth while woods watched from a few feet away.""my heart rate was up a little bit on that shot,"" said fritsch, who joked that he appreciated the large gallery, including woods, turning out to watch him hit.fritsch missed the birdie putt but squeezed into the next tournament with a 75 that left him in a tie for ninth, seven strokes behind woods, who, like fritsch, left the grounds excited about the rest of the year.",35

business,"ottawa — ever since president obama said in june that a litmus test for the proposed keystone xl oil pipeline from canada was whether it would ""significantly"" worsen global warming, canadian government officials have insisted it would not.they reasoned that because the pipeline would not have any major effect on rate of development of canada's oil sands, as a state department environmental review concluded in march, it would not significantly raise the amount of carbon emitted.but documents obtained by a canadian environmental group suggest that the staff at natural resources canada viewed keystone xl as an important tool for expanding oil sands production. the documents were released to the pembina institute, a group based in calgary, alberta, after a request made under canada's access to information act.briefing notes prepared for the natural resources minister, joe oliver, before a trip to chicago to promote keystone xl in march, noted that ""in order for crude oil production to grow, the north american pipeline network must be expanded through initiatives, such as the keystone xl pipeline project.""clare demerse, director of federal policy for pembina, said in an interview on saturday that expanding crude oil production in canada is synonymous with developing the oil sands . canada has 168 billion barrels of oil sands reserves compared to about.1 billion barrels of conventional oil reserves .""this is the heart of the debate right now,"" she said. ""the documents certainly suggest that natural resources saw keystone as essential to increasing oil sands production until the state department concluded otherwise.""indeed, in late april, before mr. oliver took his pipeline campaign to washington, the wording about growth in crude production vanished from largely similar briefing notes. it was replaced by a section noting that the state department's environmental assessment ""also concluded that 'approval or denial of the proposed project is unlikely to have a substantial impact on the rate of development in the oil sands or the amount of heavy crude oil in the gulf coast area.' ""the apparent change in canada's position underscores how approval of the pipeline from the obama administration is a major priority for the conservative government, a strong champion of the oil sands, which have brought billions of dollars into the economy . blocking the pipeline has become an equally important priority for many environmentalists who view the oil sands as a particularly dirty source of oil .in a statement, mr. oliver did not address questions about the apparent change in the government analysis of the pipeline's effect on oil sands production. but, he said: ""we agree with the u.s. state department that should keystone xl not be approved, alternative modes of transporting natural resources, including rail, would likely deliver the crude intended for the keystone xl market .""the proposed pipeline would carry about,000 barrels a day of heavy crude oil from tar sands in alberta across the great plains to gulf coast refineries . canada has the world's third-largest oil reserves after venezuela and saudi arabia, but most of them are found in bitumen, a gooey, tar-like substance mixed with sand and other minerals that must be strip mined or steamed and pumped out of the ground.in june, president obama laid out his crucial test for approval of the $7 billion project . ""allowing the keystone pipeline to be built requires a finding that doing so would be in our nation's interests,"" he said at georgetown university . ""our national interest would be served only if this project does not significantly exacerbate the problem of carbon pollution .""because removing and processing bitumen from the oil sands and converting it into crude oil generates far more greenhouse gas emissions than conventional oil production, that would seem to be a tall order.but canadian politicians have repeatedly pointed to the state department's environmental review to support their case that the pipeline would meet mr. obama's condition.that study also predicted that canada and its oil industry partners would probably continue to develop the oil sands even if keystone xl were not built. and it stated that building or not building the pipeline would have no significant effect on demand for heavy crude in the united states .""this is not going to create an environmental impact,"" mr. oliver told reporters shortly after the president's june speech.

arts,"you could call 2013 the year of the 30-something, as two of classical music's most prestigious bastions opened their doors to children of the 1980s. the polymathic nico muhly, born in, became the youngest composer to have a commissioned work performed at the metropolitan opera when his ""two boys"" had its american premiere in october. in april, caroline shaw (1982) was the youngest recipient of the pulitzer prize in music for her rapturous ""partita for eight voices.""both were works adroitly balanced between new and old. mr. muhly's opera united a musical language not far from britten with a savagely poignant plot out of the internet age . ""two boys"" remained, after years of development, a flawed piece: the central character, a female detective investigating a case of online intrigue and murder, still felt like a cipher even after the addition of a baggy back story.but while mr. muhly's style tends more toward the reflective than the propulsive, he embraced the depiction of our time with the same moving combination of plain beauty and adventurous sophistication as ms. shaw. her ""partita,"" written for the vocal octet roomful of teeth, of which she is a founding member, brought together elements that included chanting, humming, the deadpan instructions for a sol lewitt mural and a 19th-century hymn. it was an assured eclecticism utterly of our time that steered savvily clear of sentimentality.they were not the only relative youngsters to climb the field's heights this year. andris nelsons was 34 in may, when the boston symphony orchestra, one of the most storied american ensembles, announced that he would be its next music director, joining the under-40 likes of the los angeles philharmonic's gustavo dudamel and the philadelphia orchestra's yannick nézet-séguin.the ice-clear soprano angela meade, 36, and, especially, the powerhouse mezzo-soprano jamie barton, 32, brought joyful passion to bellini's ""norma"" when they took over the leads in the middle of the met's run in october. in ms. barton's focused, radiant performance, adalgisa's opening aria, ""deh! proteggimi, o dio!,"" finally felt like the prayer that it is.as pamina in los angeles opera's silent-film -inspired production of mozart's ""the magic flute"" last month, the elegant, creamy-toned soprano janai brugger, 30, embraced the production's constraints — all movements had to be synchronized with stage-filling animations — without compromising the tender force of her personality. it was a performance, like the two in ""norma,"" that was the apotheosis of the 30-something, with both the freshness of youth and the depth of age.",487
science,"scientists have found the oldest dna evidence yet of humans' biological history. but instead of neatly clarifying human evolution, the finding is adding new mysteries.in a paper in the journal nature, scientists reported wednesday that they had retrieved ancient human dna from a fossil dating back about,000 years, shattering the previous record of,000 years.the fossil, a thigh bone found in spain, had previously seemed to many experts to belong to a forerunner of neanderthals. but its dna tells a very different story. it most closely resembles dna from an enigmatic lineage of humans known as denisovans. until now, denisovans were known only from dna retrieved from,000-year-old remains in siberia, 4,000 miles east of where the new dna was found.the mismatch between the anatomical and genetic evidence surprised the scientists, who are now rethinking human evolution over the past few hundred thousand years. it is possible, for example, that there are many extinct human populations that scientists have yet to discover. they might have interbred, swapping dna. scientists hope that further studies of extremely ancient human dna will clarify the mystery.""right now, we've basically generated a big question mark,"" said matthias meyer, a geneticist at the max planck institute for evolutionary anthropology in leipzig, germany, and a co-author of the new study.hints at new hidden complexities in the human story came from a,000-year-old femur found in a cave in spain called sima de los huesos (""the pit of bones"" in spanish. the scientific team used new methods to extract the ancient dna from the fossil.""this would not have been possible even a year ago,"" said juan luis arsuaga, a paleoanthropologist at universidad complutense de madrid and a co-author of the paper.finding such ancient human dna was a major advance, said david reich, a geneticist at harvard medical school who was not involved in the research. ""that's an amazing, game-changing thing,"" he said.since the 1970s, spanish scientists have brought out a wealth of fossils from the cave dating back hundreds of thousands of years. ""the place is very special,"" said dr. arsuaga, who has found 28 nearly complete skeletons of humans during three decades of excavations.based on the anatomy of the fossils, dr. arsuaga has argued that they belonged to ancestors of neanderthals, which lived in western asia and europe from about,000 to,000 years ago .when dr. meyer and his colleagues drilled into the femur, they found ancient human dna inside, just as they had hoped.""our expectation was that it would be a very early neanderthal,"" dr. meyer said.but the dna did not match that of neanderthals. dr. meyer then compared it to the dna of the denisovans, the ancient human lineage that he and his colleagues had discovered in siberia in. he was shocked to find that it was similar.""everybody had a hard time believing it at first,"" dr. meyer said. ""so we generated more and more data to nail it down.""the extra research confirmed that the dna belonged on the denisovan branch of the human family tree .the new finding is hard to reconcile with the picture of human evolution that has been emerging based on fossils and ancient dna. denisovans were believed to be limited to east asia, and they were not thought to look so neanderthal-like.based on previously discovered ancient dna and fossil evidence, scientists generally agreed that humans' direct ancestors shared a common ancestor with neanderthals and denisovans that lived about half a million years ago in africa.their shared ancestors split off from humans' lineage and left africa, then split further into the denisovans and neanderthals about,000 years ago . the evidence suggested that neanderthals headed west, toward europe, and that the denisovans moved east.humans' ancestors, meanwhile, stayed in africa, giving rise to homo sapiens about,000 years ago . humans then expanded from africa into asia and europe about,000 years ago . they then interbred not only with neanderthals, but with denisovans, too. later, both the denisovans and neanderthals became extinct.""now we have to rethink the whole story,"" dr. arsuaga said.dr. arsuaga doubts that denisovans were spread out across so much of the old world, from spain to siberia, masquerading as neanderthals.one alternative explanation is that the humans of sima de los huesos were not true neanderthals, but belonged to the ancestors of both denisovans and neanderthals.it is also possible that the newly discovered dna was passed to both neanderthals and denisovans, but eventually disappeared from neanderthals, replaced by other variants.""it got lost in one lineage but made its way in the other,"" suggested jean-jacques hublin, a max planck paleoanthropologist who was not involved in the research.beth shapiro, an expert on ancient dna at the university of california, santa cruz, favors an even more radical possibility: that the humans of sima de los huesos belong to yet another branch of humans. they might have been a species called homo erectus, which originated about.8 million years ago and became extinct within the last few hundred thousand years.""the more we learn from the dna extracted from these fossils, the more complicated the story becomes,"" dr. shapiro said.this complicated story has come to light only because of advances over the past 20 years in retrieving ancient dna.when an organism dies, its dna breaks down into smaller and smaller fragments, while also becoming contaminated with the dna of other species like soil bacteria. so piecing the fossil dna together is a bit like putting together a jigsaw puzzle created by a sadist.in, svante paabo of the max planck institute and his colleagues, who had pioneered the techniques for retrieving dna fragments, published a snippet of dna from a neanderthal fossil dating back about,000 years. they and other scientists then built on this success by searching for bits of dna from other neanderthals.in, a team of french and belgian researchers obtained a fragment of neanderthal dna dating back,000 years, which until now held the record for the oldest human dna ever found.meanwhile, using improved methods, dr. paabo, dr. meyer and their colleagues assembled a rough draft of the entire neanderthal genome in.that discovery shed light on how neanderthals and humans' ancestors split from a common ancestor hundreds of thousands of years ago . it also revealed that neanderthals and humans interbred about,000 years ago .around the same time as that discovery, russian collaborators sent the max planck team,000-year-old fossils they had found in a cave in siberia called denisova. when the german scientists sequenced the entire genome from the finger bone of a girl, it turned out to be neither human nor neanderthal, but from a separate lineage, which dr. paabo and his colleagues named denisovans.dr. meyer is hopeful that he and his colleagues will be able to get more dna from the spanish fossil, as well as other fossils from the site, to help solve the puzzle they have now stumbled across. ""it's extremely hard to make sense of,"" dr. meyer said. ""we still are a bit lost here.""",306
science,"on sunday in the eastern united states, the sun will rise with a large bite taken out of it by the moon — a partial eclipse at dawn.early risers as far west as pittsburgh and atlanta — at least those with an unobstructed view of the eastern horizon — can observe the rare crescent sunrise. the view will be more impressive for those farther east. in new york city, sunrise is at:29 a.m. (standard time; clocks should have been set back an hour.""they will see, near the east coast, 60 percent of the sun covered by the moon,"" said jay m. pasachoff, a professor of astronomy at williams college in massachusetts . when the eclipse ends 45 minutes later, the sun will still be barely above the horizon.""you do have to have a low horizon that doesn't have trees or mountains or buildings blocking your view,"" dr. pasachoff said, adding, ""if you have windows from manhattan that look east over long island from a high floor, that should work.""the usual warnings about solar eclipses apply. do not look directly at the sun without special filters to protect your eyes from intense infrared, visible and ultraviolet light. otherwise use a pinhole to project the image onto a sheet a paper. sunglasses are not a safe way to watch a partial eclipse.solar eclipses occur because of an astronomical coincidence: as viewed from earth, the moon looks almost the same size as the sun. while people in the united states will only see a partial eclipse, farther to the east, over the atlantic ocean, the moon will pass exactly between earth and the sun. the eclipse will then move across the atlantic and sweep across central africa .when the moon blocks all of the sunlight, it is called a total eclipse. but the moon's orbit is elliptical, so sometimes it is farther away and does not completely block the sun: that leaves a ring of sunlight, a so-called annular eclipse.sunday's eclipse starts as an annular eclipse before turning total — astronomers call it a hybrid eclipse.dr. pasachoff is in gabon, in west africa, where his scientific team of, including a couple of williams students, will set up cameras and small telescopes to observe the minute-long total eclipse. it will be his 58th solar eclipse and 31 st total eclipse.even though solar scientists now rely on spacecraft for most of their sun data, dr. pasachoff says eclipses still provide unique data because observers on the ground can take pictures that reveal deeper parts of the sun's atmosphere that are too bright for the spacecraft sensors .with the sun now at the height of its sunspot cycle (though activity has been surprisingly quiet of late) dr. pasachoff hopes that his eclipse pictures can capture one of the giant explosions that fly off the sun's surface.""that complete picture is only possible on the day of an eclipse,"" he said.",212
politics,"doma case goes before supreme court : the times's john schwartz dissects the questions posed in the case against the defense of marriage act . washington — the supreme court appeared ready on wednesday to strike down a central part of a federal law that defines marriage as the union of a man and a woman, as a majority of the justices expressed reservations about the defense of marriage act .on the second day of intense arguments over the volatile issue of same-sex marriage, justice anthony m . kennedy, who most likely holds the decisive vote, returned again and again to the theme that deciding who is married is a matter for the states . the federal government, he said, should respect ""the historic commitment of marriage, and of questions of the rights of children, to the states .""that suggests that he is prepared to vote with the court's four liberal members to strike down the part of the 1996 law that recognizes only the marriages of opposite-sex couples for more than,000 federal laws and programs. such a ruling would deliver federal benefits to married same-sex couples in the nine states, and the district of columbia, that allow such unions .if the 1996 law stands, justice kennedy said, ""you are at real risk with running in conflict with what has always been thought to be the essence"" of state power, which he said was to regulate marriage, divorce and custody.all four members of the court's liberal wing questioned the constitutionality of the law, though they largely focused on equal protection principles rather than on the limits of federal power . justice ruth bader ginsburg, for instance, said the law effectively created ""two kinds of marriage : the full marriage, and then this sort of skim milk marriage .""paul d. clement, who served as solicitor general under president george w . bush and is defending the law on behalf of house republicans, argued that the federal government was entitled to use a uniform definition of marriage across the nation.mr. clement said countless laws over time had been enacted with the traditional definition of marriage in mind. when congress approved the 1996 law, he said, it was worried that if one state extended the definition to include same-sex couples, those laws would effectively be changed.""what congress says is, 'wait a minute,' "" mr. clement said of what had happened in. "" 'let's take a timeout here. this is a redefinition of an age-old institution.' "" justice elena kagan said there was something else at work.""do we really think that congress was doing this for uniformity reasons, or do we think that congress's judgment was infected by dislike, by fear, by animus and so forth?"" she asked.she read a passage from the house record at the time that said the law had been animated by a ""collective moral judgment"" to ""express moral disapproval of homosexuality.""mr. clement responded: ""of course, the house report says that. and if that's enough to invalidate the statute, then you should invalidate the statute. but that has never been your approach.""""just because a couple legislators may have had an improper motive"" is irrelevant, mr. clement said, adding that the usual question for the court was simply whether the challenged law was supported by a rational justification. solicitor general donald b. verrilli jr. said the 1996 law is deeply unfair and means, for instance, ""that the spouse of a soldier killed in the line of duty cannot receive the dignity and solace of an official notification of next of kin.""the arguments came a day after the court heard a challenge to california's proposition, which bans same-sex marriages . that argument was murky and muddled, and many of the justices' questions suggested they were looking for a way to duck the central issue.by comparison, wednesday's case was modest, and the arguments were clear. the court heard a preliminary 50-minute session on whether it had jurisdiction to hear the case, but those issues did not seem to threaten to send the case off the rails.the court appointed vicki c. jackson, a law professor at harvard, to argue a position not fully supported by any party : that the case's odd procedural posture meant the court lacks jurisdiction.",26
business,"paris — the european central bank left its benchmark interest rate unchanged at a record low on wednesday, but indicated it was ready to take steps if needed to protect the euro zone from political turmoil in the united states .""the u.s. budget shutdown is a risk if protracted,"" mario draghi, the central bank president, said at a news conference . but he added that he did not expect the two-day-old shutdown to last long.mr. draghi deflected a question about what would happen if the united states defaulted on its debt because of the deadlock in washington . he emphasized, though, that the bank was poised to intervene if needed.""we have a vast array of instruments,"" mr. draghi said. ""and we exclude no option.""but no immediate moves were announced. meeting in paris, the central bank's governing council kept its main interest rate at.5 percent, where it has been since may.in his news conference, mr. draghi repeated his assurance that the central bank would continue holding rates down, citing continued low inflation . he said the governing council had discussed a rate cut but remained divided on whether one was warranted.although the euro common currency is no longer under siege, tension in the euro zone has risen in recent weeks . there had been questions about the survival of the italian government before wednesday, when the opposition leader, silvio berlusconi, said he would support the government of prime minister enrico letta in a vote of confidence .but the partial shutdown of the american government, depending on how long it continues, could undercut demand from the united states, the euro zone's most important trading partner . moreover, the political impasse in washington raises the risk that the united states will hit the debt ceiling and begin defaulting on its debt . analysts agree a default would be catastrophic for the world economy .the euro zone has emerged from a recession that lasted a year and a half, but it is a feeble recovery that could easily be derailed by an external shock. ""we view this recovery as weak, as fragile, as uneven,"" mr. draghi said.europe has also been affected in recent months by expectations that the federal reserve in washington would soon begin reducing its economic stimulus program — a move that, when it comes, is likely to push up market interest rates at a time when many european countries are experiencing severe shortages of credit.last week, mr. draghi said the european central bank would consider a fresh installment of unlimited three-year loans to banks at the rock-bottom official interest rate. the low-cost loans are the closest thing that the european central bank has to the "" quantitative easing "" employed by the fed, and it helps make sure that banks have plenty of cash. on wednesday, though, mr. draghi declined to be specific about when such a move might be coming.a government shutdown in the united states affects europe because it unsettles financial markets, and because it reduces demand in the american market that is crucial for european exports — everything from italian ferraris to french cosmetics.""while the direct economic damage will probably be limited if government offices will be allowed to resume business after a couple of days, the political standoff will take its toll on sentiment,"" asoka wöhrmann, co-chief investment officer of deutsche asset and wealth management in frankfurt, said in an e-mail. ""it is a bad harbinger for the upcoming — and potentially more serious — debt ceiling decision"" in washington .in addition, the shutdown could weaken the dollar . that tends to hurt european exporters because their products become more expensive in dollar terms and have a more difficult time competing in the united states or other foreign markets . on wednesday, prompted in part by mr. draghi's resolve to keep rates low, the euro rallied to its highest level against the dollar since february, reaching a peak of.3606. the european central bank has plenty of room to maneuver on monetary policy . annual inflation in the euro zone fell to.1 percent in september, its lowest level in three and a half years and well below the bank's target of about 2 percent.the central bank is sworn to defend price stability above all else, and in theory it should be considering ways to increase inflation slightly. there remains a risk, however slight, that the euro zone could experience deflation, a broad decline in prices that undercuts corporate profits and investment and is associated with economic depression. deflation can be more destructive than inflation, because it is very hard to reverse.mr. draghi said inflation was in line with expectations and gave no indication the central bank was pondering measures to push inflation higher. "" inflation expectations for the euro area remain firmly anchored,"" he said.",437
sports,"boston — losing their balance in the stanley cup finals, the chicago blackhawks righted themselves wednesday night with a 6-5 overtime victory in a wild game 4 that they almost frittered away.the blackhawks tied the series by reverting to what they do best, even though it was hardly a masterpiece and they blew a pair of two-goal leads.they played a wide-open game and broke through the bruins' neutral-zone blockade . they got another clutch overtime goal from defenseman brent seabrook, whose overtime goal in game 7 beat the detroit red wings in the second round. and coach joel quenneville reunited his stars jonathan toews and patrick kane for the first time in this series.toews and kane each scored a goal, the first of the series for both of them. along with their linemate, bryan bickell, they combined for 11 shots on goal . they were all on the ice for seabrook's winner at 9 minutes 51 seconds of overtime that was assisted on by kane and bickell, with a screen provided by toews. kane and toews finished at plus-2 each, and bickell finished at plus.""i like that line,"" quenneville said. ""big picture getting reunited. they seem to have some chemistry.""the last time quenneville put kane and toews together, in game 5 of the conference finals against the los angeles kings, kane scored a hat trick, including the series winner in overtime, and toews had two assists. so after the blackhawks managed only one goal in games 2 and 3 against boston, quenneville was asked why he did not put them back together sooner.""you always get second-guessed,"" he said. ""maybe it looks like i didn't know what i was doing.""the game punctured for good any notion that the two goalies, tuukka rask of boston and corey crawford of chicago, were invincible. it was the third overtime game in four games in the series, which resumes saturday in chicago .rask, who entered the game with a.960 save percentage in this series, stopped 41 of 47 shots, an.872 mark. at one point in the third period, he tried to catch a shot from bickell that was going well wide; instead, he deflected it with his glove, it struck the crossbar and, fortunately for rask, bounced away.crawford, who entered with a.940 save percentage in the series, stopped only 28 of 33 shots, an.848 mark. he allowed all five goals to sail in over his glove. at least two of them were stoppable.""we were playing our game to a t,"" crawford said, but he acknowledged that he had a tough time in goal.

""whenever we get the chance to get back together, we complement each other.""kane added of himself, toews and bickell: ""i thought all three of us played pretty well. just playing with each other for the first time in a little while again, we feel we can get even better.""kane and toews noted that their success wednesday came against the 6-foot-9 defenseman zdeno chara, who finished the game at minus.""if you're matched up against him, try to win that battle and make some plays,"" kane said. ""we've done it for a long time in our careers, so no use backing down now, i guess."" quenneville described it best, however, in his own inimitable way.""the excitement of that line: kaner in possession, bick around with the big body, they scored some different kind of goals,"" he said. ""but jonny had a nice night.""n.h.l. general managers on wednesday approved the mandatory use of protective visors for all players entering the league . they also approved an extra two- minute penalty for a player who removes his helmet before a fight and banned the ""spin-o-rama"" move from shootouts. in a decision aimed at cutting down injuries from icing chases, hybrid icing will be used in preseason games on a trial basis. the changes are expected to be finalized by the league's board of governors later this month.",210

science,"heat stress among dairy cows is a growing problem in the united states as the climate warms and farmers look to increase production from their herds. now, researchers say farmers can predict which cows are in danger of overheating: the ones that stand for long periods without lying down.researchers from the university of arizona and northwest missouri state fitted cows with vaginal sensors that measured core body temperature and leg sensors that determined whether the animal was sitting or standing.the cows were more likely to stand for long periods when their body temperature rose above 102 degrees fahrenheit, probably because standing exposed more of their surface area to air, allowing body heat to disperse .but while that may help the cows feel cooler, it ultimately uses more energy than lying down, the researchers said. their findings were presented last week at a meeting of the american dairy science association."" heat exhaustion is a fairly common problem in summer months over most of the u.s., especially as our cows have gotten to be high-producing animals,"" said robert collier of the university of arizona .

""the flip side is he does not appear to be a policy voice arguing on behalf of fuzzing up the facts.""the tensions continued with mr. carney's defense of the white house in the investigation over whether the i.r.s. inappropriately targeted conservative groups for special scrutiny and his push back on questions relating to the the seizure of telephone records of associated press journalists, over which the press relentlessly grilled him.""i don't take it personally,"" he said of the tough questions lobbed by his former peers.mr. carney is the first full-time reporter to make the jump to the white house since ron nessen, a former nbc news correspondent, served as press secretary for president gerald r. ford. (tony snow, a press secretary for president george w . bush, worked as an opinion writer and anchor.)his role as president obama's chief spokesman was not entirely foretold by his earlier life or career choices. one of three children, he grew up in northern virginia and earned a degree in russian studies from yale. he began his reporting career at the miami herald and became time magazine's miami bureau chief in. he then was assigned to the magazine's moscow bureau, in, which he said was a career highlight.after returning to washington in, and except for a two-year stint on capitol hill, he reported on presidential campaigns and the white house, and served as time's washington bureau chief, before leaving the profession.in, mr. carney was still at time, which, like many mainstream news publications was bleeding cash and staff.",63
science,"los angeles — new research pinpoints the current location of nasa's voyager 1 spacecraft: it's still in our solar system.since last summer, the long-running spacecraft has been exploring uncharted territory where the effects of interstellar space, or the space between stars, can be felt. scientists don't know how thick this newfound region in the solar system is or how much farther voyager 1 has to travel to break to the other side.""it could actually be anytime or it could be several more years,"" said chief scientist ed stone of the nasa jet propulsion laboratory, which manages the mission.stone first described this unexpected zone at a meeting of the american geophysical union last year. a trio of papers published online thursday in the journal science confirmed just how strange this new layer is.soon after voyager 1 crossed into this region last august, low- energy charged particles that had been plentiful suddenly zipped outside while high-energy cosmic rays from interstellar space streamed inward. readings by one of voyager 1's instruments showed an abrupt increase in the magnetic field strength, but there was no change in the direction of the magnetic field lines — a sign that voyager 1 has not yet exited the solar system.voyager 1 and its twin, voyager, were launched in 1977 to visit the giant gas planets, beaming back dazzling postcards of jupiter, saturn and their moons. voyager 2 went on to tour uranus and neptune. after planet-hopping, they were sent on a trajectory toward interstellar space.voyager 1 is about 11 ½ billion miles from the sun. voyager 2 is about 9½ billion miles from the sun. the nuclear -powered spacecraft have enough fuel to operate their instruments until around.in the meantime, scientists are looking for any clues of a departure. given the time it takes to process the data, mission scientist leonard burlaga said there will be a lag between when voyager 1 finally sails into interstellar space and when the team can confirm the act. then there's always the possibility of surprises beyond the solar system.""crossing may not be an instantaneous thing,"" burlaga said. ""it may be complicated.""",480
business,"building an investment portfolio that produces enough income to live on is one of the main goals of retirement planning, but lately the goal posts have shifted. with interest rates stuck near record lows, retirees must have more saved up to produce the same income through the usual high-quality investments, like treasury bonds, or else they must venture into assets with higher yields but potentially higher riskan alternative approach that financial advisers increasingly find appealing is to replace lost income with greater flexibility. instead of seeking to generate more income, they say, investors should acquire a mix of assets that can produce greater total return — income plus capital growth — from which to finance retirement needs."" investors have to look beyond the old strategy and realize that they're being constrained by the idea that they should never sell principal,"" said david kelly, chief market strategist at j. p. morgan funds . ""they should take systematic withdrawals from their portfolio, whether they come from dividend income, coupon payments or from selling appreciated growth stocks .""if that seems like a risky proposition — what if growth stocks depreciate? — lex zaharoff, head of the investment lab at citi private bank, an in-house portfolio analysis group, suggests that a heavy concentration in bonds comes with its own hazards, starting with a lack of diversification.""the danger of being overly focused on boosting yields is that some investors fall into the trap of boosting yields by a single dimension,"" he said. ""if they own longer-dated bonds, they're taking on risk if rates go up suddenly.""what can make a fixation on income especially risky nowadays is that while many advisers have begun to take a more ""holistic, multidimensional approach,"" mr. zaharoff said, the quest for income by others with a more traditional approach has pushed prices too high and yields too low on many investments. "" valuations matter,"" he said.they also matter to christopher m. zelesnick, senior managing director at ziegler wealth management in chicago, who likewise finds few palatable options among income -producing assets. he considers it sensible to own high-yield corporate bonds, for instance, in anticipation of rising interest rates and an economic revival, the sort of backdrop that is anathema to treasury issues, but lofty valuations are putting him off."" high-yield bonds perform well if the economy is improving,"" he said. ""the problem today is that a lot of investors have run to that side of the fence and lowered yields below where they should be.""jordan waxman, managing director of the financial advisory firm hightower in new york, acknowledges that decent income is harder to achieve. yet he detects it in enough corners of the markets, and with acceptable levels of risk, for retirees to avoid having to dip into their capital.""with the caveat that you can't squeeze blood from a stone,"" he said, ""i would be in the camp that you should secure cash flow from investments to the extent that you can do that. there are areas that might be overlooked that can still get you where you need to go.""the destination he has in mind is an average yield of 5 to 6 percent. his preferred vehicles include two that offer tax advantages that inflate investors' net yields: high-yield municipal bonds and master limited partnerships, which are businesses engaged mainly in oil and gas transportation — the type of partnerships he favors — and production.mr. waxman also likes blue-chip stocks that pay big dividends. if that seems like a perilous choice with the stock market at multiyear highs, he points out that different kinds of stocks have enjoyed the rally to different degrees.""the stock market has had a very nice recovery led by low-quality companies,"" he said. ""most financially stable, rock-solid companies have not participated as much. prices are similar to where they were 13 years ago ."" higher-yielding stocks are a popular choice among investment advisers, whichever retirement-planning philosophy they adhere to, because they allow investors to have their cake and eat it, too.""dividend-paying stocks have yields close to 10-year treasury yields, and in addition they have growth prospects,"" mr. zelesnick said. ""as a business does better it can increase its dividend.""mr. zaharoff is a fan of stocks with healthy yields, too, particularly ""well-regarded global companies that have strong franchises and plenty of cash,"" he said. ""you want companies to be growing profitably and choosing to distribute some of that back in dividends.""when trying to find the right mix of assets to produce a suitable mix of income and growth, investment advisers recommend using a professional because of the need to juggle the various market niches along with the needs and wants of investors . which sort of professional is best depends on the approach an investor wants to take.""there are two approaches,"" mr. kelly said. ""work with a financial adviser to put together an appropriate portfolio, explaining what your risk tolerances and income needs are, and let the adviser figure out whether you're going to be selling assets to derive that income . another way to go is to buy a broad asset-allocation mutual fund and set it up to take withdrawals every month.""he considers a global income fund, with holdings in many markets and asset classes, to be a particularly good option, but he stresses to investors that how they put their money into the markets has nothing to do with how they take it back out.""they should separate the distribution part from the strategic-allocation part,"" mr. kelly said. ""they're two separate issues. people often get them confused.""",18
