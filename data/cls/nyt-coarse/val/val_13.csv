arts,"there's not much that melissa mccarthy will let stand in the way of where she wants to go: not the limited vision of hollywood, not the perceptions of her detractors and certainly not sandra bullock.the scene they were filming on their action comedy ""the heat,"" in which ms. mccarthy and ms. bullock play mismatched law-enforcement officers, was a seemingly straightforward one in which the actresses would try to force themselves through a doorway at the same time. but that's when ms. mccarthy saw the opportunity to have some fun with her co-star and decided to get aggressive.as a calmer, gentler ms. mccarthy would later recall the moment: ""i thought, i may just have one shot at this. i'm going to push sandy bullock as hard as i can. i'm, like, really, really shoving her.""the seemingly fragile ms. bullock did not just stand there and take it, either. ""she's tiny but she's mighty and she would push back,"" ms. mccarthy said.

business,"paris — france can no longer rely on tax increases to fix its finances . that was the conclusion on thursday of the state auditor who warned that president françois hollande's government would have no choice but to cut billions of euros in spending if it was to meet european union deficit targets by.the court of auditors, france's official accounting agency, noted that public finances had been held in check for several years through higher taxes and control of spending . but it said the policy had now reached its limits. if the european union's 3 percent budget deficit target is to be reached by, the report said, structural spending cuts ""on the order of"" 13 billion euros, or $17 billion, would be needed in 2014 along with 15 billion euros of cuts in.french tax increases have brought howls of protest from businesses and higher-income taxpayers, and led to a flight of the country'swealthy to lower- tax destinations like britain, belgium and switzerland.mr. hollande and his finance minister, pierre moscovici, have already vowed that taxes will not increase further, and that their task over next few years is to cut spending . but they have been vague on how they intend to do it. and so far, mr. hollande has repeatedly had to revise his budget deficit targets because he was unable to meet them, even prompting brussels to acknowledge that france would need more time. newly gloomy economic indicators released thursday will not make the task any easier.the challenge is to rein in public spending in a country with generous welfare and pension benefits and a bloated public sector . france's social spending last year was among the highest in the world, at more than 30 percent of gross domestic product, according to philippe d'arvisenet, global chief economist at b.n.p. paribas. ""it's getting more difficult to afford this type of generosity,"" he said. public spending made up.6 percent of g.d.p. last year, the auditors found, up from.9 percent in 2011 — and just below the record high of.8 percent set in. tax receipts, meanwhile, rose to a record 45 percent of g.d.p. in.""everyone agrees this is where the next effort has to come from,"" gilles moëc, an economist at deutsche bank in london, said. cuts on the scale suggested by the auditors are ""doable,"" he said, at just over 1 percent of g.d.p.the government has essentially conceded the point in recent months, he said, but it has not provided any details about how it intends to go about doing it.""it's one thing to say spending cuts are necessary,"" mr. moëc said, ""and another thing altogether to flesh them out.""mr. d'arvisenet noted that about 80 percent of all the progress in cutting the deficit in recent years had come from tax increases, something that he said ""obviously"" could not be long sustained. the french auditors' findings are consistent with the advice of the international monetary fund and the european commission, he added. the central government in paris has sometimes chosen to save money by reducing transfers to the provinces. planned overhauls of the pension, family benefits and unemployment insurance systems could also help over the medium term . but there is little sign of the kind of immediate measures that would be needed to bring the deficit down to 3 percent.the court of auditors said the 2013 budget deficit was likely to come in between.8 percent and.1 percent of g.d.p., as receipts of corporate and sales taxes decline and the economy shrinks. while that would mark a decline from.8 percent last year, it remains above the.7 percent for which mr. hollande's government has been aiming.france's problems partly result from the economic downturn . the french economy contracted by.2 percent in both the first quarter of this year and the last quarter of. insee, the national statistics institute, predicted last week that it would shrink by.1 percent this year.the government's forecasts are still more optimistic than those of some private forecasts . standard & poor's estimated thursday that the french economy would shrink by.3 percent this year, before returning to growth with a.6 percent expansion in.the jobless rate stood at 11 percent in april, according to eurostat, the european union's statistical agency. expectations that it will rise further are weighing on consumer confidence .french household sentiment reached an all-time low in june, insee said thursday, with its main consumer sentiment index falling to, down one point from the may reading, which had itself been a record low .france, like the other 16 euro members, is obligated by treaty to hold its deficit to around 3 percent of g.d.p. and its debt to 60 percent of g.d.p. mr. hollande committed to meeting the deficit target in his 2012 presidential campaign . but european officials, bowing to the inevitable, in late may gave france until 2015 to achieve it in return for action on pension and labor reforms.among the major euro zone economies, only germany is currently on track to meet the e.u. budget target, with a deficit of only.2 percent of g.d.p. forecast for this year, according to the organization for economic cooperation and development . the united states, in contrast, is likely to record a 2013 budget deficit of.4 percent, the o.e.c.d. said.many economists argue that the deficit rules are counterproductive in an economic downturn, because cutting government spending adds to the downward pressure on demand . the mathematical logic of the deficit -to-g.d.p. equation dictates that, even when spending is unchanged, the outcome is worse if the economy shrinks.despite the skepticism about austerity, and recent signs of relaxation in the rhetoric, the orthodox view, championed by chancellor angela merkel of germany and her allies, continues to hold sway in europe.in britain, prime minister david cameron's government on wednesday announced.5 billion pounds, or.5 billion, more of spending cuts to be enacted over the next few years. the office of national statistics reported thursday that the british economy grew by only.3 percent in the first quarter, a.2 percent annualized rate.but that was an upward revision from the previous estimate . the office said that, contrary to earlier readings, the british economy did not slip into a ""double- dip"" recession last quarter of 2011 and the first quarter of.",370

""she knows what to say to help me get through a lot of different situations.""mathews's pro prospects were hard to fathom five years ago . in high school in camarillo, calif., he was not offered a scholarship by any football bowl subdivision team. at cornell, he immediately wanted to prove his worth to the programs that passed him over.""when he showed up on his visit, he said, 'great, which room do i watch film in?' "" cornell coach david archer said. ""the intangible love of football is the first thing you noticed.""mathews, who said he has dreamed of playing in the n.f.l. since he was a child, entered his freshman season as a reserve, but the starter, adam currie, broke his arm two plays into cornell's first game of, against wagner. with injuries affecting two other quarterbacks, mathews was thrust into duty. for the next four years, cornell had its man behind center.a high point for mathews came in his sophomore season, when he threw for a combined,069 yards and 10 touchdowns in victories against columbia and penn in the final two games.after those contests, katie called and they talked about his accomplishments, but the statistics meant little to him.""every time we talk to each other, i'm always so excited about the records he's broken,"" katie said, ""and after i get all my excitement over, he just stops me and says, 'katie, that sounds great and all, but i want to hear about you.' ""she was 16 when she was traveling in the front passenger seat of a friend's car to a party in may. she called for directions and put the call on speakerphone for the driver. the driver did not recognize the exit in time and swerved sharply, losing control and flipping the car several times. the driver broke her leg. the roof collapsed on katie. today, she lives independently in texas and travels the country as a motivational speaker and advocate against distracted driving.still speaking of the phone calls with her brother, she said: ""he always pushes the focus back on me. he knows what's important in life.""jeff mathews's selflessness is also evident to his teammates and coaches. j. c. tretter, a former cornell offensive lineman who is a rookie with the green bay packers, said mathews was ""extremely team oriented.""this season, against teams with frequent blitzes like princeton, mathews adjusted by throwing shorter routes and screen passes, forgoing the long ball, which would impress the dozen-plus scouts on hand, in hopes of a team victory.""that's all he's ever wanted,"" archer said, ""to win football games for cornell.""mathews said, ""ultimately, when you don't win games, you've got to look internally about what you can do to make sure you're playing better and giving your team a chance to win .""",366
politics,"just a few months after leaving the state department, hillary rodham clinton has plunged into the lucrative world of paid speechmaking, joining a branch of the family business that has brought the clintons more than $100 million since her husband left the white house in.for about,000, mrs. clinton will offer pithy reflections and mitch albom-style lessons from her time as the nation's top diplomat. (""leadership is a team sport ."" ""you can't win if you don't show up."" ""a whisper can be louder than a shout."")she sticks around for handshakes and picture-taking, but the cost of travel, and whether a private jet is provided, must be negotiated as part of her fee.the,000 she commands appears to be comparable to what bill clinton receives for speeches delivered in this country, though mr. clinton — who earned $17 million from speeches last year — has collected much more outside the united states, including the,000 he was paid when he spoke to a company in lagos, nigeria.convention organizers are eager to pay mrs. clinton, and, since leaving office in february, she has embarked on a packed schedule of events for groups like the american society of travel agents and the national association of realtors .but joining what is known in washington as the buckraking circuit carries risks for mrs. clinton, who prides herself on a long career in public office and could be diminished by the free-flowing money as she considers a run for president in.the senators who may face off against her in three years are barred from taking such honorariums. past presidential candidates, including former gov . mike huckabee of arkansas, have drawn scrutiny for the practice; mr. huckabee memorably left the presidential campaign trail in 2008 to deliver an address in the cayman islands . ""i'm not independently wealthy,"" mr. huckabee said at the time. ""i wish i was. i have to make a living.""the events are also giving mrs. clinton large captive crowds as she considers a run for president. she shows a personal side, according to several people who have attended her speeches this summer. along with reminisces about her mother, dorothy rodham, she gushes about her daughter, chelsea, and tells the oft-shared story of the first time she heard her husband's southern drawl as he described ""the size of watermelons in arkansas .""but she does not shy away from policy. last month, about,000 people filed into mccormick place, a convention center in chicago, where mrs. clinton, in prepared remarks, talked about health care changes, as well as border security and immigration. ""i hope it's heading to a new law that will resolve a lot of these issues,"" she told the crowd . ""it's way overdue.""she praised the human resource managers gathered for their conference. ""you know what it takes to provide workers the flexibility and benefits that they need to care for their children,"" she said.at a time when almost everything mrs. clinton publicly says feeds presidential speculation, she has also used the speeches to address issues like the arab spring, the conflict in syria and the former national security agency contractor edward j. snowden.mrs. clinton does not make her speechmaking schedule public, but the trade groups typically publicize the events. a spokesman for the former first lady declined to comment .but her political rivals have already started to keep tabs on her speaking schedule, looking for any hint of a conflict of interest.

politics,"in colorado, a state of hunters and sportsmen, the democrats who control state government acted last month not only to expand background checks for gun sales, but also to ban the kind of high-capacity magazines that gunmen have used in recent mass shootings in newtown, conn., aurora, colo., and tucson.but in washington, a federal ban on high-capacity magazines faces long odds, as the democratic white house has been struggling to get traction on its broad gun agenda even in the democratic-led senate .the reason for the disparity lies not just in the complicated, emotional politics of guns in america — there was fierce lobbying in opposition to colorado's new gun laws, and threats were even reported against some lawmakers who supported it — but also in the way that the senate's arcane rules make it so much harder to pass bills there than in the nation's statehouses .even as gun control advocates grew optimistic tuesday that they would be able to muster the 60 votes needed to overcome a threatened filibuster, it was evident that the senate bill was unlikely to include many of the steps that president obama initially called for after adam lanza killed 20 first graders and 6 educators in newtown last december with a semiautomatic rifle and several 30- round magazines .a federal assault weapons ban — which the president called for again this week at an emotional rally in connecticut — will not be included in the senate's main gun bill. a ban on high-capacity magazines appeared in doubt as well. most of the frenzied last-ditch negotiations in washington were aimed at salvaging a measure that had seemed almost assured of passage in the senate just months ago : universal background checks for gun sales, which have overwhelming public support and which a number of republican senators had appeared open to earlier in the year.why has it been so much harder for senate democrats to pass gun bills than it was for colorado democrats ? the answer lies in the unforgiving math of senate procedure. colorado's most contentious new law, which banned magazines that hold more than 15 rounds of ammunition, passed its state senate with 51 percent of the vote, and no republican support. but because of the rules of the united states senate, democrats effectively need 60 percent of the vote to overcome the threat of filibusters and pass legislation there.that contrast helps explain why the nation's post-newtown gun debate has not always followed the script that some predicted in the immediate aftermath of the shooting. new gun restrictions in colorado, new york, connecticut and maryland went further than many advocates on both sides had initially expected. at the national level, though, the president has faced an even steeper climb than many expected as he has labored to persuade the senate to act on expanded background checks .not that passing new gun regulations in the states was easy.an increasingly urban colorado relishes its frontier image, and its democratic governor, john w. hickenlooper, had seemed cool to gun control in the past. but a combination of timing and tragedy paved the way for the bills that passed there last month. many democrats were galvanized to act after a gunman strode into a movie theater in aurora in july and opened fire on the full midnight house, killing, wounding dozens and evoking painful memories of an earlier shooting: the 1999 massacre at columbine high school .then democrats won control of both houses of the state legislature in november, putting action within reach. in mid-december, mr. hickenlooper said the time had come to re-examine the state's gun laws . then came the newtown shooting . lawmakers knew they did not have much time.""we meet 120 days out of the year,"" said representative dominick moreno, a democrat from commerce city, northeast of denver . ""you can't fiddle around like congress does.""the opposition was fierce. gun owners thronged the capitol, and opponents of gun restrictions circled the building in their cars one day, honking loudly enough to be heard inside. an airplane circled overhead another day towing a banner that read, ""why does hick hate guns?""",34
science,"cape canaveral, fla. — now he knows what it's like to be a goldfish in a fishbowl.two days after his helmet flooded during a spacewalk, astronaut luca parmitano relived the experience thursday, describing how water kept trickling into his helmet until big globs covered his eyes, then his nose. it was hard to see, he said, and he could not hear.""for a couple of minutes there, maybe more than a couple of minutes, i experienced what it's like to be a goldfish in a fishbowl — from the point of view of the goldfish,"" parmitano said in a tv interview from the international space station .parmitano said he used his memory to make his way back into the space station . his spacewalking partner, christopher cassidy, was a big help.the 36-year-old italian air force officer said he was ""miserable but ok"" as tuesday's spacewalk came to an abrupt end.""imagine walking around with your eyes closed in a fishbowl. really, that's what was going on... it's just a very uncomfortable feeling to be with your face underwater for all that time,"" he said.parmitano, a former test pilot, said he was lucky to get back inside so quickly. he figures there was 3 pounds of water floating inside his helmet when his crewmates yanked it off; that's nearly a half-gallon.nasa managers have said parmitano could have choked or drowned, and praised his calmness during the ordeal.parmitano's colleagues grabbed towels to mop his bald head once the 1½-hour spacewalk ended. some water bubbles escaped and floated away.the astronauts as well as engineers in houston are still trying to figure out what went wrong. parmitano's drink bag has been ruled out. the only other possibility is the cooling system for his suit. parmitano said his long underwear, containing water tubes, appears to be fine.""i'm sure that they will find both the problem and the solution,"" parmitano said.parmitano became italy's first spacewalker last week. his spacesuit functioned perfectly the first time around. tuesday's excursion was a continuation of the maintenance work, none of which was urgent.the trouble began barely an hour into spacewalk.parmitano said he felt cold water on the back of his head. within a few minutes, he felt it covering his ears.""the water kept trickling until it completely covered my eyes and my nose,"" parmitano said.the sun was setting as the spacewalkers made their way back, making it harder to maneuver in the darkness.""all those things sort of came together at the perfect storm, so to speak, for us to deal with,"" cassidy told tv reporters.cassidy said the space station crew reviewed the spacewalk procedures in advance and discussed possible emergencies.""but lo and behold, what happened was not one of those items that we discussed,"" said cassidy, 43, a former navy seal .""my own gut feeling,"" cassidy said, ""i knew it was time to end it when i saw the water creeping around his communications cap, kind of right by his eyelid. i knew that was a significant amount of water to be in a helmet, and it was time to go in.""parmitano was low key as he recounted the experience. once the helmet came off, he said, ""that was the end of it.""spare spacesuits are on board in the event of a space station emergency. nasa wants to be certain the problem is isolated to parmitano's suit before sending any more astronauts outside.",318
business,"american employers have a variety of job vacancies, piles of cash and countless well-qualified candidates . but despite a slowly improving economy, many companies remain reluctant to actually hire, stringing job applicants along for weeks or months before they make a decision.if they ever do.the number of job openings has increased to levels not seen since the height of the financial crisis, but vacancies are staying unfilled much longer than they used to — an average of 23 business days today compared to a low of 15 in mid, according to a new measure of labor department data by the economists steven j. davis, jason faberman and john haltiwanger.some have attributed the more extended process to a mismatch between the requirements of the four million jobs available and the skills held by many of the 12 million unemployed. that's probably true in a few high-skilled fields, like nursing or biotech, but for a large majority of positions where candidates are plentiful, the bigger problem seems to be a sort of hiring paralysis.""there's a fear that the economy is going to go down again, so the message you get from c.f.o.'s is to be careful about hiring someone,"" said john sullivan, a management professor at san francisco state university who runs a human resources consulting business . ""there's this great fear of making a mistake, of wasting money in a tight economy .""as a result, employers are bringing in large numbers of candidates for interview after interview after interview. data from glassdoor.com, a site that collects information on hiring at different companies, shows that the average duration of the interview process at major companies like starbucks, general mills and southwest airlines has roughly doubled since.""after they call you back after the sixth interview, there's a part of you that wants to say, 'that's it, i'm not going back,' "" said paul sullivan, 43, an exasperated but cheerful video editor in washington . ""but then you think, hey, maybe seven is my lucky number. and besides, if i don't go, they'll just eliminate me if something else comes up because they'll think i have an attitude problem.""like other job seekers around the country, he has been through marathon interview sessions. mr. sullivan has received eighth- and ninth -round callbacks for positions at three different companies . two of those companies, as it turned out, ultimately decided not to hire anyone, he said; instead they put their openings ""on hold"" because of budget pressures.at one company, while signing into the visitor's log for the sixth time, he was chided by the security guard .""he thought i worked there and just kept forgetting my security badge,"" mr. sullivan said. ""he couldn't believe i was actually there for another interview. i couldn't either! but then i put on a happy face, went upstairs and waited for another round of questions.""the hiring delays are part of the vicious cycle the economy has yet to escape: jobless and financially stretched americans are reluctant to spend, which holds back demand, which in turn frays employers' confidence that sales will firm up and justify committing to a new hire. job creation over the last two years has been steady but too slow to put a major dent in the backlog of unemployed workers, and the february jobs report due out on friday is expected to be equally mediocre. uncertainty about the effect of fiscal policy in washington is not helping expectations for the rest of the year, either.""if you have an opening and are not sure about the economy, it's pretty cheap to wait for a month or two,"" said nicholas bloom, an economics professor at stanford university . but in the aggregate, those little delays, coupled with fiscal uncertainty, are stretching out the recovery process. ""it's like one of those horror movies, an economic friday the 13th, where this recession never seems to die."" employers might be making candidates jump through so many hoops partly because so many workers have been jobless for months or years, and hiring managers want to make sure the candidates' skills are up to date, said robert shimer, an economics professor at the university of chicago .but there's also little pressure to hire right now, so long as candidates are abundant and existing staff members are afraid to refuse the extra workload created by an unfilled position. employers can keep dragging out the hiring process until they're more confident about their business — or at least until they find the superstar candidate.""they're chasing after that purple squirrel,"" said roger ahlfeld, 44, of framingham, mass., using a human resources industry term for an impossibly qualified job applicant.",266
sports,"east rutherford, n.j. — on a day that had been set aside to discuss the nets ' plans for thursday's n.b.a. draft, attention at the team's training facility shifted from potential future players to a current star. general manager billy king spent a majority of his time monday talking about a bent screw that had been replaced in brook lopez's surgically repaired right foot.king said the bent screw was discovered on x- rays when lopez had his physical after the nets were eliminated by the chicago bulls in the first round of the playoffs. the procedure, which took place sometime after the nets' season ended on may, was strictly precautionary, according to the nets . they expect lopez to return to basketball - related activities sometime in august.lopez, who averaged.4 points and.9 rebounds in 74 games last season as he made his first all-star team, has now had three operations on his right foot since. two unrelated fractures in the foot cost him most of the 2011-12 season.king said that lopez was in a walking boot and that his rehabilitation would take place in the new york city area . king stressed several times that lopez would be fine, and that he had not experienced any pain by the bent screw.""for me, i don't have any concern,"" king said. ""it didn't prevent him from playing.""faced mostly with questions about lopez and what appears to be a weeks-old surgery, king dealt with fewer inquiries than expected about the nets' plans for their first-round pick, the 22nd over all, on thursday.king did mention that the nets could benefit from a draft class that is projected to produce more solid, complementary players than stars.""for where we are, it's better because you're going to get guys who are more polished and more who they are,"" he said. ""they may not be a franchise guy, but they could be a good piece.""king said his priorities this off-season would be to acquire athletic players who could shoot from the perimeter.one of the nets' biggest needs is finding a suitable backup point guard for deron williams . the nets expect c. j. watson, who held that role last season, to opt of out of his contract and become a free agent . king did not mention watson on monday, instead saying he wanted to bring in another guard who could compete for the role with tyshawn taylor, whom the nets obtained from the portland trail blazers in last year's draft.two such players who could fit that bill and have been projected to be selected somewhere in the high teens to low 20s in the draft are guards tim hardaway jr . and erick green, the most notable of the six players the nets invited for a workout. king, who was not asked about hardaway or green, brushed off the suggestion that he would consider taking a center as insurance for lopez.""no, not at all,"" he said.king, after pausing for few seconds, then laughed and added: ""there's nobody as good as brook lopez in the draft, either. we know the guys we want to have, and brook is going to be our starter.""",196

business,"london — the british government signaled on tuesday that it was intensifying its efforts to encourage the development of shale gas production, with plans to award a new set of shale drilling licenses next year despite persistent opposition from environmental groups .""today marks the next step in unlocking the potential of shale gas in our energy mix,"" energy minister michael fallon said in a statement on tuesday. britain's department of energy and climate change, which regulates the oil and gas industry, said it was ""currently making preparations"" to offer the licenses. environmental groups have warned that shale gas development, done through hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, would swamp british villages with truck traffic, and pollute and waste enormous amounts of water. they also say that britain and the world should be investing in renewable energy sources like wind and solar rather than opening up a new trove of fossil fuels .""real energy security in the u.k. can only be achieved through clean renewable sources and energy efficiency,"" greenpeace said on tuesday. ""fracking is a dangerous distraction.""the government's decision means that 2014 could be a crucial year for determining whether shale gas production takes off in britain. companies may be able to drill enough wells to figure out whether the country has large and exploitable reserves.next year may also determine whether the local authorities, which tend to be more skeptical than the national government of the potential value of shale gas, will allow a substantial amount of exploration work. shale gas operators say they are encouraged despite very little drilling activity currently. the british geological survey estimated this year that a large area in the middle of britain had,300 trillion cubic feet, or.8 trillion cubic meters, of shale gas in place. if 10 percent of that amount could be produced, it would be enough for about 45 years of current consumption.""only a year since restrictions on hydraulic fracturing were lifted we have now got a complete suite of measures under which we can operate,"" said andrew austin, the chief executive of igas energy, a shale gas company that is drilling at the barton moss site near manchester, england.what is particularly worrying to environmental groups is a government map indicating that a very large part of britain — greenpeace says two-thirds of the land area of england — is under consideration for shale gas licenses.""there's no public mandate for this industrialization of the english countryside and for digging up new forms of fossil fuels,"" anna jones, a greenpeace campaigner, said in a statement on tuesday. the british government stands out in western europe for pursuing potential gains from shale gas, which has transformed the energy market in the united states . even though countries like france and germany are big importers of natural gas and other fuels, their governments are nervous about taking the political heat that an approval of fracking would almost certainly generate.the picture is different in eastern europe, with the polish government courting shale developers in hopes of reducing its dependence on coal and gas imports from russia. ukraine and romania have also made long-term shale gas deals with oil companies including chevron. the british government is trying to convince the public that shale gas will be an economic boon rather than an environmental headache. mr. fallon said that local communities would receive,000 pounds, or about,000, for each well that was hydraulically fractured and that almost £1 billion might eventually be paid out to communities across britain as they receive 1 percent of the revenue from each producing well during its 20-year lifetime.the government on tuesday also published a series of booklets detailing the rules for obtaining drilling and fracking permits, and it released an environmental assessment prepared by an energy consulting firm, amec, that presented an optimistic picture of the effects of fracking.the report, the ""strategic environmental assessment for further onshore oil and gas licensing,"" said that if a large number of licenses were awarded, oil and gas companies might produce in total more than twice the amount of gas consumed in britain per year. it also estimated that shale gas exploration and production, if successful, could create,000 to,000 jobs .but the amec report also noted some potential negatives, including large-scale water use and the possibility that fracking sites might require up to 51 truck visits per day for 145 weeks. but it said that tough planning restrictions and other regulation could ensure that such issues would not ""be unacceptable in the local context.""mr. fallon, the energy minister, said the government would consider comments on the report before going ahead with the licensing round.",3

science,"i lay on my back with my teeth clenched and my hands gripping the sides of a hospital bed. a crowd of strangers in white coats filled the tiny room. waves of pain lapped from my abdomen into my chest as the venom worked its way toward my heart.an experimental antivenin drug was about to be injected into my bloodstream, and while i waited for the needle to go in, i reflected that if anyone in the world was the right person to be bitten by a black widow spider, i was that guy.as a professional outdoorsman, i spend a lot of time around things that can bite, claw, stab or otherwise attack me. i have been lucky with snakes and reckless with bears . i have had some close calls with lionfish. it figures that the thing to finally nail me would be living on my own front porch.the black widow's graceful form and red hourglass marking have made it america's most recognizable spider. the eastern species, latrodectus mactans, is common from florida to new york and as far west as texas .but despite their fearsome reputation, black widows are surprisingly shy and retiring. over the course of your life, you have probably walked past hundreds of black widows without even realizing it. each one packs enough venom to lay out a heavyweight boxer for days, yet globally only a few people each year are killed by widow bites.widow webs are easy to identify, messy and close to the ground. i spotted the first one knitted against the steps of my front porch, in albemarle county, va. a little black ballerina was balanced in the back of it. i regretted killing her, but she was too close to an area where my children play. i blasted her with wasp spray, and she dropped out of her web .i hunted for more to photograph and eliminate. the perimeter of my house turned out to harbor a village of black widow webs. i racked up as many as a dozen little black-and-red trophies a day. fascinated by our proximity, i sought to learn more about these deadly neighbors.the black widow is unfairly named. female spiders rarely kill the male after mating, and possibly only in captivity. the male looks very different from the mature female; he is smaller and brownish. (the hourglass marking is quite variable in both sexes.) both sexes carry the same venom, but the females have more of it and their fangs can inject it deeper.one winter day, i carried inside a basket my children had left on the front lawn. i noticed a withered-looking black widow clinging to its side, still alive but stiff and slow with the cold. i dropped her into a mason jar, and for three months, she lived on my desk on a diet of moths.i learned a lot about black widows just by observing her. they are awkward outside their webs. they are poor climbers compared with other spiders, unable to scale the side of a jar. i was surprised that my pet widow never used her venom first. when confronted by prey that was too large or aggressive, she backed off rather than bite.one warm spring afternoon, i decided to go fishing for dinner. on the same front porch where i had removed so many black widows, i kept a pair of water shoes and some fishing tackle. i put the shoes and the tackle in my car and drove eight miles to my favored hole.i donned the shoes before walking to the edge of the water. within about a dozen steps, i felt a stinging sensation on the second toe of my left foot, as if there had been a thorn inside the shoe. then the pain increased to about that of a wasp's sting. i sat on a rock and removed the shoe. the squashed remains of a spider were smeared across the insole. i realized instantly what must have happened: a black widow from the porch had made its home in my shoe.for a long moment, i stared at my throbbing toe and wondered what to do.some people are more affected by the venom than others. most healthy adults experience a lot of pain and recover on their own. but others become incapacitated, and some die. which group would i fall into? or had i been bitten by something else entirely? why make a big deal out of nothing?i decided to wait and find out before getting behind the wheel. i dipped my foot into the cool water and decided i might as well pass the time by fishing.",32
science,"scientists have found the oldest dna evidence yet of humans' biological history. but instead of neatly clarifying human evolution, the finding is adding new mysteries.in a paper in the journal nature, scientists reported wednesday that they had retrieved ancient human dna from a fossil dating back about,000 years, shattering the previous record of,000 years.the fossil, a thigh bone found in spain, had previously seemed to many experts to belong to a forerunner of neanderthals. but its dna tells a very different story. it most closely resembles dna from an enigmatic lineage of humans known as denisovans. until now, denisovans were known only from dna retrieved from,000-year-old remains in siberia, 4,000 miles east of where the new dna was found.the mismatch between the anatomical and genetic evidence surprised the scientists, who are now rethinking human evolution over the past few hundred thousand years. it is possible, for example, that there are many extinct human populations that scientists have yet to discover. they might have interbred, swapping dna. scientists hope that further studies of extremely ancient human dna will clarify the mystery.""right now, we've basically generated a big question mark,"" said matthias meyer, a geneticist at the max planck institute for evolutionary anthropology in leipzig, germany, and a co-author of the new study.hints at new hidden complexities in the human story came from a,000-year-old femur found in a cave in spain called sima de los huesos (""the pit of bones"" in spanish. the scientific team used new methods to extract the ancient dna from the fossil.""this would not have been possible even a year ago,"" said juan luis arsuaga, a paleoanthropologist at universidad complutense de madrid and a co-author of the paper.finding such ancient human dna was a major advance, said david reich, a geneticist at harvard medical school who was not involved in the research. ""that's an amazing, game-changing thing,"" he said.since the 1970s, spanish scientists have brought out a wealth of fossils from the cave dating back hundreds of thousands of years. ""the place is very special,"" said dr. arsuaga, who has found 28 nearly complete skeletons of humans during three decades of excavations.based on the anatomy of the fossils, dr. arsuaga has argued that they belonged to ancestors of neanderthals, which lived in western asia and europe from about,000 to,000 years ago .when dr. meyer and his colleagues drilled into the femur, they found ancient human dna inside, just as they had hoped.""our expectation was that it would be a very early neanderthal,"" dr. meyer said.but the dna did not match that of neanderthals. dr. meyer then compared it to the dna of the denisovans, the ancient human lineage that he and his colleagues had discovered in siberia in. he was shocked to find that it was similar.""everybody had a hard time believing it at first,"" dr. meyer said. ""so we generated more and more data to nail it down.""the extra research confirmed that the dna belonged on the denisovan branch of the human family tree .the new finding is hard to reconcile with the picture of human evolution that has been emerging based on fossils and ancient dna. denisovans were believed to be limited to east asia, and they were not thought to look so neanderthal-like.based on previously discovered ancient dna and fossil evidence, scientists generally agreed that humans' direct ancestors shared a common ancestor with neanderthals and denisovans that lived about half a million years ago in africa.their shared ancestors split off from humans' lineage and left africa, then split further into the denisovans and neanderthals about,000 years ago . the evidence suggested that neanderthals headed west, toward europe, and that the denisovans moved east.humans' ancestors, meanwhile, stayed in africa, giving rise to homo sapiens about,000 years ago . humans then expanded from africa into asia and europe about,000 years ago . they then interbred not only with neanderthals, but with denisovans, too. later, both the denisovans and neanderthals became extinct.""now we have to rethink the whole story,"" dr. arsuaga said.dr. arsuaga doubts that denisovans were spread out across so much of the old world, from spain to siberia, masquerading as neanderthals.one alternative explanation is that the humans of sima de los huesos were not true neanderthals, but belonged to the ancestors of both denisovans and neanderthals.it is also possible that the newly discovered dna was passed to both neanderthals and denisovans, but eventually disappeared from neanderthals, replaced by other variants.""it got lost in one lineage but made its way in the other,"" suggested jean-jacques hublin, a max planck paleoanthropologist who was not involved in the research.beth shapiro, an expert on ancient dna at the university of california, santa cruz, favors an even more radical possibility: that the humans of sima de los huesos belong to yet another branch of humans. they might have been a species called homo erectus, which originated about.8 million years ago and became extinct within the last few hundred thousand years.""the more we learn from the dna extracted from these fossils, the more complicated the story becomes,"" dr. shapiro said.this complicated story has come to light only because of advances over the past 20 years in retrieving ancient dna.when an organism dies, its dna breaks down into smaller and smaller fragments, while also becoming contaminated with the dna of other species like soil bacteria. so piecing the fossil dna together is a bit like putting together a jigsaw puzzle created by a sadist.in, svante paabo of the max planck institute and his colleagues, who had pioneered the techniques for retrieving dna fragments, published a snippet of dna from a neanderthal fossil dating back about,000 years. they and other scientists then built on this success by searching for bits of dna from other neanderthals.in, a team of french and belgian researchers obtained a fragment of neanderthal dna dating back,000 years, which until now held the record for the oldest human dna ever found.meanwhile, using improved methods, dr. paabo, dr. meyer and their colleagues assembled a rough draft of the entire neanderthal genome in.that discovery shed light on how neanderthals and humans' ancestors split from a common ancestor hundreds of thousands of years ago . it also revealed that neanderthals and humans interbred about,000 years ago .around the same time as that discovery, russian collaborators sent the max planck team,000-year-old fossils they had found in a cave in siberia called denisova. when the german scientists sequenced the entire genome from the finger bone of a girl, it turned out to be neither human nor neanderthal, but from a separate lineage, which dr. paabo and his colleagues named denisovans.dr. meyer is hopeful that he and his colleagues will be able to get more dna from the spanish fossil, as well as other fossils from the site, to help solve the puzzle they have now stumbled across. ""it's extremely hard to make sense of,"" dr. meyer said. ""we still are a bit lost here.""",306
politics,"ossining, n.y. — one morning last summer, connie knapp got a phone call from her minister. several days earlier, the supreme court had handed down a ruling fortifying the movement for same-sex marriage . her pastor, the rev. chip low, had a feeling that ms. knapp and her partner, anne corey, might want to have a wedding.for going on 30 years, since they had met in a running club and fallen in love over spaghetti with clam sauce at a chelsea diner, ms. knapp and ms. corey had considered themselves a couple. yet even after gay marriage was allowed in new york state, they had vowed not to wed as long as the defense of marriage act remained a federal law .now the high court had struck down a key part of the measure, which had denied federal benefits to married same-sex couples . after years of enduring opprobrium from religious conservatives, of being told that gays and lesbians were evil and immoral and intrinsically disordered and had provoked the almighty to cause, the women had a friendly minister who had hung the rainbow flag outside his church and was offering to officiate at their ceremony.there was just one obstacle. ms. knapp, born and raised catholic, was now a presbyterian studying for the ministry. ms. corey was from a reform jewish background. the women, both, were about to discover that in an era of growing acceptance of gay marriage, they would have no trouble finding clergy members ready to perform a same-sex ceremony. an interfaith ceremony, however, looked like a deal-breaker.if the realization took them by surprise, ms. knapp and ms. corey were far from alone. as tolerance for same-sex marriage rapidly grows, interfaith gay couples are finding that the same spiritual leaders who support the civil right to wed might object on theological grounds to religiously mixed ceremonies.""i have absolutely observed that increasing phenomenon over the years,"" said idit klein, the executive director of keshet, an advocacy organization for jews who are lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender . ""i've seen it go from being difficult to find a rabbi to officiate at same-sex weddings to now having rabbis call me and say, 'i've never done a gay wedding and i want to' — a real eagerness to show solidarity. something profound has shifted.""""but what hasn't shifted appreciably is most rabbis' views of interfaith marriage,"" ms. klein said. ""having interfaith families in their congregation is one thing, but officiating at the wedding is another.""keshet has a database of 713 rabbis or synagogues willing to perform same-sex weddings . of those, however, ms. klein estimated, only about 20 percent are willing to hold interfaith ceremonies. within the reform jewish movement, which has a decades-long record of supporting gay rights, only about half of its rabbis will conduct interfaith ceremonies, regardless of a couple's sexual orientation . the conservative movement's rabbinical association has published guidelines for same-sex weddings, but prohibits its members from presiding at interfaith weddings.the varying rules and norms within the rabbinate, in turn, put christian clergy members in a reactive position. among ministers willing to perform same-sex weddings, even within the faith, almost all are from the liberal mainline protestant denominations .at ground level, as couples like ms. knapp and ms. corey have discovered, fixed rules sometimes matter less than personal comfort levels. some rabbis will marry an interfaith couple if the entire liturgy is judaic; others, if the couple promise to raise their children as jews. some rabbis will co-officiate with non-jewish clergy, while some will not. they may or may not accept the use of non-jewish symbols and texts within the ceremony.mixing and matching heritages had seemed simple to ms. knapp and ms. corey for most of their decades together. they have held lesbian seders annually since the mid-1980s, with their own cut-and-paste haggadot. ms. corey goes to church with ms. knapp on christmas and easter. they read from a book of religious meditations each morning.",270
business,"aberdeen, scotland — chevron said on tuesday that it had awarded contracts worth more than £550 million, or more than $844 million, on its planned rosebank and alder oil and gas development projects in british waters.if the company decides to proceed with the projects to produce oil and gas from the fields, it would wind up spending billions of pounds on platforms, drilling equipment and undersea systems. the key subsea contract announced on tuesday appeared to be won by a joint venture between the oil services giant schlumberger and the american valve maker cameron international — perhaps best known in lay circles as the maker of the blowout preventer that failed in the gulf of mexico oil disaster in.others that won chevron contracts announced tuesday included aker solutions, a norwegian oil and gas equipment maker, and technip, a french oil services management company . peter blake, chief of chevron's subsea operations, said all of the underwater equipment for the project would probably be made in europe.rosebank, an oil and natural gas field, is on what is becoming one of europe's key fossil-fuel frontier areas, the margins of the atlantic ocean west of the shetland islands off scotland. alder, a gas field, is in the central north sea, which is also attracting major new investments. northeast scotland has evolved into the hub of britain's and in some respects europe's oil industry, with hundreds of suppliers of high-tech services and undersea gear.chevron, based in san ramon, calif., has been studying rosebank since it discovered oil there in. a final decision on whether to develop the field is not expected until next year. but chevron and its partners, including statoil of norway, have already spent hundreds of millions of pounds on early drilling and design work, stuart klein, the project's chief, said in an interview in the company's european headquarters in aberdeen. oil companies are ramping up spending in the north sea and west of the shetlands. lindsay wexelstein, an analyst at the consultancy wood mackenzie in edinburgh, estimates that the industry will spend $65 billion over the next five years, the most in real terms since the 1970s, including $18 billion west of the shetlands. the rosebank project, if it proceeds, is likely to require the largest amount of capital during the coming period, she said. oil and gas uk, a trade group, forecasts oil industry investment in britain at £14 billion this year, about triple what it was five years ago . as a result, production, which has fallen sharply in recent year to about.5 million barrels per day, is likely to begin rising, the group says.rosebank has required years of work because of the field's tricky geology. the oil is contained in layers of sandstone sandwiched between volcanic basalt rock, which is difficult to penetrate with the seismic imaging technology that the industry uses. mr. klein said that to obtain better images of the oil and gas, chevron put 750 sensors on the sea bottom in 2010 and 2011 and then spent two years analyzing the resulting data. ""there is less uncertainty than three years ago,"" he said.mr. klein said that rosebank would probably have 240 million barrels of recoverable oil and gas . producing the oil will cost billions of dollars .chevron executives in aberdeen said that recent changes in the british tax system, giving allowances of up to £3 billion for deepwater projects in the area, had made the project viable in chevron's portfolio, assuming that the oil fields earn $25 per barrel or more. rosebank, which is in,600 feet of water and is being designed to survive 100-foot waves, is believed to be the only project that would qualify for those tax allowances so far.chevron is also a.6 percent nonoperating partner on clair, europe's largest oil field, which is being gradually developed by a group led by bp. clair is in the same area as rosebank but in much shallower water. the three projects represent ""the future of chevron europe,"" mr. klein said.",472

politics,"des moines — senator ted cruz calls his colleague rand paul a ""good friend."" the two men are the stars of the tea party movement, propelled to washington by activist fervor and allied in their effort to restrain the reach of the federal government .but when mr. cruz went to new york city to meet with donors this summer, he privately offered a different view of mr. paul: the kentucky senator can never be elected president, he told them, because he can never fully detach himself from the strident libertarianism of his father, former representative ron paul of texas .word of mr. cruz's remarks reached mr. paul's inner circle, touching off anger and resentment.and the incident further inflamed a rivalry that has been quietly building as the republican party tries to grapple with the force and power of its tea party wing. both mr. cruz and mr. paul harbor presidential ambitions and view themselves as representing a new, more energized movement of republican activists . but they are pursuing distinctly different paths as they try to rise, diverging not just in style but in their approach to intraparty politics.mr. cruz and his aides believe he is uniquely suited to galvanize conservatives, pointing to his leadership of the effort to cut off funding for the affordable care act — confrontational, pugnacious, disdainful of president obama . mr. cruz, 42 — a texan, a born-again baptist and son of an evangelical preacher — also connects naturally with christian conservatives, many of whom have become foot soldiers in the tea party and view mr. paul as too unorthodox on social issues .mr. paul's inner circle privately derides mr. cruz as ""the chief of the wacko birds,"" echoing a phrase from senator john mccain of arizona . and, while allowing mr. cruz to lead the charge on obamacare, the kentucky senator has quietly been reaching out to more establishment forces within the republican party, trying to prove to big donors and mainline republican organizations that he is more than a tea party figure or a rerun of his father's failed candidacies.in september, mr. paul mingled with new york financial titans at the central park west penthouse of woody johnson, the jets owner and johnson & johnson heir, who hosted a republican national committee fund-raiser with a group of potential 2016 republican contenders.a few weeks later, at the four seasons in washington, mr. paul appeared at a closed-door american crossroads foreign policy panel and then posed for pictures with donors to the "" super pac,"" which was co-founded by karl rove, a despised figure among some tea party activists .and while mr. paul first won office by taking on the anointed senate candidate of kentucky's senior senator, mitch mcconnell, mr. paul is now helping mr. mcconnell's re- election effort and joined him and other establishment republicans at a lobbyist-filled fund-raising retreat for the national republican senatorial committee last month in sea island, ga.the divergent strategies undertaken by mr. cruz and mr. paul not only put them on a collision course should they both pursue presidential candidacies. they also could help determine whether the tea party — right now a muscular and rebellious force within the republican party — remains at war with the establishment or is eventually more smoothly integrated into the party apparatus.mr. paul and those close to him are confident that his die-hard libertarian -leaning supporters will not desert him, and that gives him freedom to build bridges beyond that base.""he's becoming a translator between the grass-roots conservatives and the establishment,"" said trygve olson, a consultant who bridges the two wings. he then added an implicit dig at other republicans : ""he's actually demonstrating leadership.""transcending the two worlds can be tricky: while mr. paul voted with mr. cruz on the effort to defund the health care law — pre-empting future primary attacks from the right — he also said publicly over the summer that he thought shutting the government down was ""a dumb idea."" privately, he complained during the shutdown that the effort was futile and was damaging the party .still, he is clearly the beneficiary of the comparison with mr. cruz: establishment republicans are lining up to heap praise on mr. paul, using words like ""grown"" and ""matured"" to describe him and the role he played during the shutdown.""this ordeal showed a side of rand that i though was politically very smart in terms of his tone and trying to distance himself from a strategy that clearly didn't play well for us,"" senator lindsey graham, republican of south carolina, said in an interview.",15
politics,"washington — a new book from a conservative advocate of tighter campaign finance regulations seeks to draw attention to a number of questionable but legal fund-raising activities — some potentially damaging, others certainly embarrassing — that could prove uncomfortable for some on capitol hill .the author is peter schweizer, a fellow at stanford university's hoover institution, whose last book focused on how members of both parties enriched themselves by trading stock based on information they obtained by virtue of their positions in congress . the book — and the news coverage of it — helped lead to the stock act, which banned insider trading for representatives and senators but stopped far short of the systemic changes advocates like mr. schweizer said were necessary.mr. schweizer hopes his new book, titled ""extortion,"" will help push congress to address loopholes in the campaign finance system, including banning ""leadership pacs,"" which allow politicians to spend and solicit money without many of the restrictions they face when using their dedicated campaign committees .these groups, mr. schweizer argues, have essentially become slush funds that enable lavish lifestyles while they exist ostensibly to help members of congress finance their own campaigns and help political allies.the book details the extravagant expenses of senator saxby chambliss, republican of georgia, for instance, whose leadership pac spent,000 on golf at pebble beach, nearly,000 at ruth's chris steakhouse, and,752 at the exclusive breakers resort in palm beach, fla. the amount mr. chambliss spent at the breakers in the 2012 election cycle, the book reports, is three times what the senator gave to the national republican senatorial committee during the same period. senator roy blunt, republican of missouri, racked up,000 in expenses during the 2012 cycle at a resort on south carolina's exclusive kiawah island, the book says. that was more than he transferred to his party's senatorial committee, despite raising.1 million .a spokeswoman for mr. chambliss said that every fund-raiser and expenditure was documented and reported according to the law, and that he gave the maximum allowed to his colleagues . mr. blunt's office did not respond to a request for comment . democrats come out looking equally profligate . the book points out that representative charles b. rangel of new york used his leadership pac to pay for a painting of himself that cost,500. representative rosa l. delauro of connecticut used hers to pay for catered parties at her home several times a month.the book also seeks to draw attention to the influence that businesses have over elected officials, which has become a galvanizing cause for conservatives like mr. schweizer and tea party activists, whose brand of politics thrives on the tension of outsiders working against a system they believe is corrupted by insider interests.mr. schweizer's work, in addition to being picked up by more mainstream news media like cbs's ""60 minutes,"" receives considerable attention on conservative web sites like daily caller and breitbart, where mr. schweizer is an editor at large.",350

business,"in december, the federal aviation administration allowed airbus, the european plane maker, to use 14-ounce lithium-ion batteries to provide standby power for the emergency lighting system of its new a380 jumbo jet .ten months later, the agency allowed boeing to use the same volatile type of battery on its new 787 plane. but in boeing's case, the batteries weighed 63 pounds each, were to be used in critical flight systems as well as to provide backup power, and would be charged and discharged much more often. yet the agency's ruling used identical language — it could have been just cut and pasted — in laying out the broad safeguards for using the batteries that it had given airbus to follow.the use of lithium batteries in the 787 is at the center of the difficulties involving boeing. the plane maker has staked its reputation on the success of the, an aircraft it nicknamed the dreamliner. all 50 787s delivered to airlines worldwide were grounded last week until investigators in the united states and japan find out why two lithium batteries failed in recent weeks, causing a fire on one 787 and damage to another that led to an emergency landing .it also raises fundamental questions about how federal regulators certify new technology and how they balance advances in airplane design and engineering with ensuring safety in commercial flying. in addition to finding out what went wrong, these issues will be examined in a federal investigation and at future senate hearings.when it approved boeing's request in, the f.a.a. said it had limited experience with the use of lithium-ion batteries in commercial airplanes, though it acknowledged that the batteries themselves were more prone to fire than traditional nickel-cadmium or lead-acid batteries .still, the agency approved the technology on the assumption that boeing could make the batteries work and that computer controls could prevent batteries from overcharging or overheating. the agency also specified that any fire or toxic leak be contained and not damage any surrounding electrical systems .at the same time, the agency brushed off concerns raised in 2006 and 2007 by the air line pilots association that a fire in flight would be difficult to extinguish and that flight crews should be given extra training.""we have concluded that providing a means for controlling or extinguishing a fire — such as stopping the flow of fluids, shutting down equipment, or fireproof equipment"" was an ""adequate alternative to requiring the flight or cabin crew to use extinguishing agents,"" the agency said in its 2006 decision about the airbus a.experts said that regardless of the cause of the 787's problems, the charred remains of the battery that caught fire earlier this month in a plane in boston raised the question of whether the safeguards functioned properly.on wednesday, the national transportation safety board, which is investigating the battery fire in boston, said that all eight cells in the battery had sustained "" varying degrees of thermal damage."" six of them have been scanned and disassembled for further examination.many battery experts said they viewed boeing's decision to use lithium-ion batteries as a reasonable one and pointed out that lithium-ion batteries had also been used in expensive space satellites since around 2000 without serious problems. they said that track record would have added to the confidence boeing and federal regulators had about using them in commercial airliners.jay f. whitacre, an associate professor of engineering at carnegie mellon university, said gs yuasa, the japanese company that built the 787 batteries, told the national aeronautics and space administration in a 2008 presentation that it had already supplied batteries for six satellites and had contracts for 50 more. gs yuasa also said that its satellite batteries had never had a shorting incident in more than 10 years of production.""that's pretty compelling,"" professor whitacre said.

politics,"washington — national health spending climbed to.7 trillion in, or an average of,700 for every person in the country, but as a share of the economy, it remained stable for the third consecutive year, the obama administration said monday.the rate of increase in health spending, 3.9 percent in, was the same as in 2009 and 2010 — the lowest annual rates recorded in the 52 years the government has been collecting such data. federal officials could not say for sure whether the low growth in health spending represented the start of a trend or reflected the continuing effects of the recession, which crimped the economy from december 2007 to june. kathleen sebelius, the secretary of health and human services, said that ""the statistics show how the affordable care act is already making a difference,"" saving money for consumers . but a report issued by the centers for medicare and medicaid services, in her department, said that the law had so far had ""no discernible impact"" on overall health spending .although some provisions of the law have taken effect, the report said, ""their influence on overall health spending through 2011 was minimal.""the recession increased unemployment, reduced the number of people with private health insurance, lowered household income and assets and therefore tended to slow health spending, said micah b. hartman, a statistician at the centers for medicare and medicaid services .in the report, federal officials said that total national spending on prescription drugs and doctors' services grew faster in 2011 than in the year before, but that spending on hospital care grew more slowly. medicaid spending likewise grew less quickly in 2011 than in the prior year, as states struggled with budget problems. but medicare spending grew more rapidly, because of an increase in ""the volume and intensity"" of doctors' services and a one-time increase in medicare payments to skilled nursing homes, said the report, published in the journal health affairs. national health spending grew at roughly the same pace as the overall economy, without adjusting for inflation, so its share of the economy stayed the same, at.9 percent in, where it has been since. by contrast, health spending accounted for just.8 percent of the economy in. health spending grew more than 5 percent each year from 1961 to. it rose at double-digit rates in some years, including every year from 1966 to 1984 and from 1988 to.the report did not forecast the effects of the new health care law on future spending . some provisions of the law, including subsidized insurance for millions of americans, could increase spending, officials said. but the law also trims medicare payments to many health care providers and authorizes experiments to slow the growth of health spending .""the jury is still out whether all the innovations we're testing will have much impact,"" said richard s. foster, who supervised the preparation of the report as chief actuary of the medicare agency. ""i am optimistic. there's a lot of potential. more and more health care providers understand that the future cannot be like the past, in which health spending almost always grew faster than the gross domestic product .""evidence of the new emphasis can be seen in a series of articles published in the archives of internal medicine, now known as jama internal medicine, under the title ""less is more."" the series highlights cases in which ""the overuse of medical care may result in harm and in which less care is likely to result in better health."" total spending for doctors' services rose.6 percent in, to $436 billion, while spending for hospital care increased.3 percent, to.6 billion. spending on prescription drugs at retail stores reached $263 billion in, up.9 percent from, when growth was just four-tenths of 1 percent. the latest increase was still well below the average increase of.8 percent a year from 2000 to. federal officials said the increase in 2011 resulted partly from rapid growth in prices for brand-name drugs.prices for specialty drugs, typically prescribed by medical specialists for chronic conditions, have increased at double-digit rates in recent years, the government said. in addition, spending on new brand-name drugs — those brought to market in the previous two years — more than doubled from 2010 to, driven by an increase in the number of new medicines .""in,"" the report said, "" spending for private health insurance premiums increased.8 percent, as did spending for benefits . out-of-pocket spending by consumers increased.8 percent in, accelerating from.1 percent in 2010 but still slower than the average annual growth rate of.7 percent"" from 2002 to.",190

business,"campaigns for web sites that offer lodging reservations usually feature colorful characters, perhaps to counter the prosaic, transactional nature of e-commerce. among them are the roaming gnome, for travelocity; the negotiator, played by william shatner, for priceline; hordes of animated travelers, for hotels .com; and a man in a crash helmet delivering price assurance checks, for orbitz.a competitive web site is taking a decidedly different tack as it begins its first image campaign, as part of efforts to raise its brand's profile among american travelers. the campaign, which is to start on tuesday, promotes booking.com, a unit of the priceline group that operates separately from priceline.the booking.com campaign, with an initial budget estimated at more than $35 million, will include commercials on television and in movie theaters as well as ads online . the campaign is being created by the amsterdam office of wieden & kennedy, which was chosen after an unpublicized review that also included agencies based in cities like new york and san francisco .the priceline group classifies booking.com, founded in, as one of its international brands, along with agoda.com and rentalcars.com. booking.com, based in amsterdam, has been offering accommodations at american hotels, motels and resorts for the last six years, said paul j. hennessy, chief marketing officer at booking.com.""it's time for our coming-out party,"" mr. hennessy said in an interview on friday in midtown manhattan as he offered a preview of the campaign. ""the u.s. is one of the largest travel markets in the world and we see great potential there.""it is also one of the most competitive travel markets, mr. hennessy acknowledged. but, he said, he believes there is an opening for booking.com because the lodging web sites that are familiar to americans have ""commoditized the market "" by ""all pounding the same message of low-price guarantees and best prices.""""american customers are ready for a new hero, if you will,"" mr. hennessy said, ""and booking.com could be that hero.""to underline that, the campaign will celebrate what mark bernath, the executive creative director at wieden & kennedy amsterdam who joined mr. hennessy for the interview, called ""the delight of right"" — that is, the potential moment of truth when a traveler who booked a room online "" opens the door and has a first look"" and is pleased or relieved, rather than dismayed or disgusted, by what he or she finds inside.""the pressure on the booker can be quite intense,"" mr. bernath said, ""so anyone who puts the best tools into your hands"" to produce a positive outcome will be perceived ""as a good partner to have.""that is perhaps more relevant in the united states than in europe, said mr. bernath, an american who has worked at wieden & kennedy amsterdam since.""the plight of the american traveler,"" mr. bernath said, is that the number of days of vacation ""is less than in europe.""as a result, ""it's more crucial, if you have two weeks instead of four or five, to nail it,"" he added, when booking accommodations.that is brought to life in the 60-second commercial that will serve to introduce the campaign. the spot takes a tongue-in-cheek approach, presenting a family of five on vacation in the dramatic way that nfl films covers a super bowl .""this vacation has been a year in the planning,"" a stentorian narrator says as the family walks, in slow motion, down a hotel hallway, and ""hinges on"" the reaction to the room.""the door opens,"" the narrator says.

science,"on sunday in the eastern united states, the sun will rise with a large bite taken out of it by the moon — a partial eclipse at dawn.early risers as far west as pittsburgh and atlanta — at least those with an unobstructed view of the eastern horizon — can observe the rare crescent sunrise. the view will be more impressive for those farther east. in new york city, sunrise is at:29 a.m. (standard time; clocks should have been set back an hour.""they will see, near the east coast, 60 percent of the sun covered by the moon,"" said jay m. pasachoff, a professor of astronomy at williams college in massachusetts . when the eclipse ends 45 minutes later, the sun will still be barely above the horizon.""you do have to have a low horizon that doesn't have trees or mountains or buildings blocking your view,"" dr. pasachoff said, adding, ""if you have windows from manhattan that look east over long island from a high floor, that should work.""the usual warnings about solar eclipses apply. do not look directly at the sun without special filters to protect your eyes from intense infrared, visible and ultraviolet light. otherwise use a pinhole to project the image onto a sheet a paper. sunglasses are not a safe way to watch a partial eclipse.solar eclipses occur because of an astronomical coincidence: as viewed from earth, the moon looks almost the same size as the sun. while people in the united states will only see a partial eclipse, farther to the east, over the atlantic ocean, the moon will pass exactly between earth and the sun. the eclipse will then move across the atlantic and sweep across central africa .when the moon blocks all of the sunlight, it is called a total eclipse. but the moon's orbit is elliptical, so sometimes it is farther away and does not completely block the sun: that leaves a ring of sunlight, a so-called annular eclipse.sunday's eclipse starts as an annular eclipse before turning total — astronomers call it a hybrid eclipse.dr. pasachoff is in gabon, in west africa, where his scientific team of, including a couple of williams students, will set up cameras and small telescopes to observe the minute-long total eclipse. it will be his 58th solar eclipse and 31 st total eclipse.even though solar scientists now rely on spacecraft for most of their sun data, dr. pasachoff says eclipses still provide unique data because observers on the ground can take pictures that reveal deeper parts of the sun's atmosphere that are too bright for the spacecraft sensors .with the sun now at the height of its sunspot cycle (though activity has been surprisingly quiet of late) dr. pasachoff hopes that his eclipse pictures can capture one of the giant explosions that fly off the sun's surface.""that complete picture is only possible on the day of an eclipse,"" he said.",212
arts,"since its founding 30 years ago, harlem stage has burnished its reputation by presenting innovative artists like bill t. jones and vijay iyer and plumbing social issues . now, the theater is betting that ""makandal"" — its first opera commission and an ambitious, contemporary work revolving around the leader of an 18th-century slave revolt in haiti — will raise its international profile and win it respect as a producer. but the group faces large hurdles.for starters, harlem stage still needs to raise about,000 for its plan to produce and tour the multimedia opera in the united states, haiti and south africa once it has its premiere next fall at the company's 196-seat performing-arts center, called the gatehouse, at 135th street and convent avenue in hamilton heights. while harlem stage's works have traveled before, it has never before taken sole responsibility for producing and touring. there are also a host of practical considerations in transferring the two-hour opera's video projections, animation and lighting to places like a park in port-au-prince .still, patricia cruz, harlem stage's executive director, views ""makandal"" as an opportunity to attract new financers and producing partners for the organization, which has an annual operating budget of around $3 million . and between the upheaval in egypt, immigration debates and the fallout over the killing of trayvon martin, she said the times were right to use the escaped slave and rebel françois makandal to explore questions about immigration, race and liberation .""it is super-ambitious,"" ms. cruz said of the project. ""in order to advance our work and the artists we present, we need to do more — not just in the harlem community or just in new york."" she said the opera form allows its creators ""to mix the mythic, the historic and contemporary tragedies with the idea of hope and the idea of change.""""makandal"" was five years in the making. it was conceived and written by carl hancock rux, who is also a performance artist . his work includes the play ""talk,"" and he originated the title role in robert wilson and bernice johnson reagon's opera, ""the temptation of st . anthony."" the director is lars jan, a genre-bending media artist. jazz, classical and traditional afro-cuban music ripple through the score, written by yosvany terry, a composer born in cuba. edouard duval-carri, the visual designer whose politically charged art is featured in the opera, was born in port-au-prince .with nine actors (all trained singers) playing multiple roles, ""makandal"" also tells the contemporary story of a boatload of cuban, dominican and haitian immigrants embarking on a boat ride to a better life. it is a layered story: in the center is the tale of makandal, a slave who escapes a haitian plantation, hides out in the hills, leads a group of revolutionaries plotting an overthrow of colonial powers and is captured and burned alive at the stake in the public square in cap-haïtien in. ""makandal"" is not strictly biographical, though, as it shifts between myth and reality, the past and the present.harlem stage officials say the opera project is well on its way. performance spaces in both south africa and haiti are in the pipeline, although ms. cruz declined to name them. a ""making makandal"" marketing and fund-raising campaign will begin in september, with events like films, readings and concerts leading up to the premiere, for which no date has been set. one-third of the approximately,000 needed has already been raised from individual donors, corporations and foundations.""i think it's within their capacity,"" said sandra l. gibson, an arts consultant and former president of the association of performing arts presenters, with,000 members worldwide.

science,"like ocean waters around the world, the chesapeake has become more and more acidic as a result of rising levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. now, by studying oyster populations in relation to acidity levels, a team of researchers has concluded that oysters — particularly their shells — can play a significant role in reducing that acidity.""oyster shells are made out of calcium carbonate, so they're sort of like an antacid pill,"" said george waldbusser, an assistant professor of earth, ocean and atmospheric sciences at oregon state and an author of the study, which appears in the journal ecology.

arts,"salzburg, austria — on a cool afternoon in march, a crowd filled the festspielhaus here to see the german conductor christian thielemann lead the dresden staatskapelle in wagner's ""parsifal."" it was the dress rehearsal, three days before the production's premiere as the opening-night attraction of the salzburg easter festival and an early celebration of wagner's 200th birthday, which falls on wednesday.""parsifal"" begins with a calm, quiet ascent up six notes of an a-flat scale. the score is marked ""sehr langsam"" — very slow — and conductors tend to oblige. some, from wilhelm furtwängler to james levine, have lingered over the first three notes in particular, as if dropping a pebble into a pond and waiting for the ripples to subside before dropping another. it is, after all, a solemn and rather mystical prelude to a solemn and rather mystical opera.in salzburg it seemed, at first, that mr. thielemann was taking the passage too fast. the first notes seemed to breeze by, closer to the opening bar of a johann strauss waltz than to the somber intonations of a christian allegory. the movement was almost too quick to allow for weight.then the sixth bar arrived. the violas began pages of rolling, barely audible arpeggios, and the brasses took up the deliberate, melancholy melody. gradually the mood came to feel less hurried than pastoral, less pushing than flowing.""every time i do things, i change a lot,"" mr. thielemann said in an interview in his dressing room . ""this time i think i'm faster with 'parsifal' than i used to be. i was surprised i took less than:35 for act i, which is very fast but sounds normal to me now.""the performance swiftly started to take on the quality that, more than any other, has made mr. thielemann, at, one of the most acclaimed wagner conductors in the world: a naturalness, an ease, a sense of the music simply unfolding.some musicians, including very good ones, lead ""parsifal"" so that every note sounds interpreted, every phrase a decision. mr. thielemann offers the illusion that interpretation has been suspended, that he is simply presenting the score, immaculate.in the german-speaking world mr. thielemann is one of the most celebrated names in classical music, the heir to storied maestros like furtwängler and herbert von karajan. longtime watchers of the vienna scene say that he is as big an audience draw there as beloved star singers like anna netrebko and jonas kaufmann, or bigger.but after high-profile and successful concert and opera dates in america, britain and elsewhere through the 1990s and early 2000s, mr. thielemann retrenched in the last decade, concentrating on a select few engagements in germany and austria and rarely traveling abroad.""i think people do too much nowadays, and there is a lack of quality,"" he said. ""and these people — some people — have a terrible personal life . i had wonderful invitations, and many places are still asking, but i don't know how to do it. i also want to have a private life. i don't want my whole life to be in hotels and airplanes.""it is hard to think of another conductor today on mr. thielemann's level whose schedule is so restricted, dominated by performances of the canonical austro-german repertory in the austro-german cities of dresden, where he is principal conductor of the staatskapelle; vienna, where he makes frequent appearances with the philharmonic; and bayreuth, at the annual summer wagner festival, where he assisted early in his career, made his debut in, led a brilliant ""ring"" cycle in 2006 and is now the de facto music director.during one of his few appearances at the metropolitan opera years ago, a met patron lent mr. thielemann the use of an apartment with a view of central park to make him feel more at home.""but he didn't feel at home,"" joseph volpe, the company's general manager at the time, said by phone . ""he's at home in germany, i guess. i think it was quite apparent after the 'frau' "" — a gleaming new production of strauss's ""frau ohne schatten"" in 2001 — ""that he didn't want to spend a lot of time here.""mr. thielemann was born into a comfortable, cultured family in west berlin in, the only child of a pharmacist mother and a father who ran a steel factory . he started out as a pianist and violist, studying at the karajan academy, associated with the berlin philharmonic, and eventually serving as an assistant to herbert von karajan himself.",409
science,"buckets of blickets: children and logic: a game developed by researchers at the university of california, berkeley, hopes to show how imaginative play in children may influence development of abstract thought.other species play, but none play for as much of their lives as humans do, or as imaginatively, or with as much protection from the family circle. human children are unique in using play to explore hypothetical situations rather than to rehearse actual challenges they'll face later. kittens may pretend to be cats fighting, but they will not pretend to be children; children, by contrast, will readily pretend to be cats or kittens — and then to be hannah montana, followed by spider-man saving the day.and in doing so, they develop some of humanity's most consequential faculties. they learn the art, pleasure and power of hypothesis — of imagining new possibilities. and serious students of play believe that this helps make the species great.the idea that play contributes to human success goes back at least a century. but in the last 25 years or so, researchers like elizabeth s. spelke, brian sutton-smith, jaak panksepp and alison gopnik have developed this notion more richly and tied it more closely to both neuroscience and human evolution. they see play as essential not just to individual development, but to humanity's unusual ability to inhabit, exploit and change the environment.dr. gopnik, author of ""the scientist in the crib"" and ""the philosophical baby,"" and a professor of psychology at the university of california, berkeley, has been studying the ways that children learn to assess their environment through play. lately she has focused on the distinction between ""exploring"" new environments and ""exploiting"" them. when we're quite young, we are more willing to explore, she finds; adults are more inclined to exploit.to exploit, one leans heavily on lessons (and often unconscious rules) learned earlier — so-called prior biases. these biases are useful to adults because they save time and reduce error: by going to the restaurant you know is good, instead of the new place across town, you increase the chance that you'll enjoy the evening.most adults are slow to set such biases aside; young children fling them away like bad fruit.dr. gopnik shows this brilliantly with a game she invented with the psychologist david sobel (her student, now a professor at brown. in the game, which has the fetching name blickets, players try to figure out what it is that makes an otherwise undistinguished clay figure a blicket. in some scenarios you can win even if you're applying a prior bias. in others you can't.last summer i joined dr. gopnik behind a wall of one-way glass to watch her lab manager, sophie bridgers, play the game with an extremely alert 5-year-old, esther.seated at a child-size table, esther leaned forward on her elbows to watch as ms. bridgers brought out a small bin of clay shapes and told her that some of them were blickets but most were not.""you cannot tell which ones are blickets by looking at them. but the ones that are blickets have blicketness inside. and luckily,"" ms. bridgers went on, holding up a box with a red plastic top, ""i have my machine. blicketness makes my machine turn on and play music .""it's a ruse, of course. the box responds not to the clay shapes but to a switch under the table controlled by ms. bridgers.now came the challenge. this version of the blicket game, which gopnik developed in collaboration with berkeley colleagues christopher lucas and tom griffiths, can be played by either of two rules, called ""and"" and ""or."" the ""or"" version is easier: when a blicket is placed atop the machine, it will light the machine up whether placed there by itself or with other pieces. it is either a blicket or it isn't; it doesn't depend on the presence of any other object.in the ""and"" trial, however, a blicket reveals its blicketness only if both it and another blicket are placed on the machine; and it will light up the box even if it and the other blicket are accompanied by a non-blicket. it can be harder than it sounds, and this is the game that esther played.first, ms. bridgers put each of three clay shapes on the box individually — rectangle, then triangle, then a bridge. none activated the machine. then she put them on the box in three successive combinations.2. rectangle and bridge: machine lighted up and played a tune!ms. bridgers then picked up each piece in turn and asked esther whether it was a blicket. i had been indulging my adult (and journalistic) prior bias for recorded observation by filling several pages with notes and diagrams, and i started flipping frantically through my notebook.",177
science,"braintree, mass. — conventional wisdom and popular perception hold that american students are falling further and further behind in science and math achievement. the statistics from this state tell a different story.if massachusetts were a country, its eighth graders would rank second in the world in science, behind only singapore, according to timss — the trends in international mathematics and science study, which surveys knowledge and skills of fourth and eighth graders around the world. (the most recent version, in, tested more than,000 students in 63 nations .) massachusetts eighth graders also did well in mathematics, coming in sixth, behind korea, singapore, taiwan, hong kong and japan . the united states as a whole came in 10th in science and 9th in math, with scores that were above the international average.of course, timss is only one test, and achievement tests are incomplete indicators of educational prowess. but behind massachusetts' raw numbers are two decades of sustained efforts to lift science and mathematics education . educators and officials chose a course and held to it, even when the early results were deeply disappointing.while massachusetts has a richer and better-educated population than most states, it is not uniformly wealthy. the gains reflected improvement across the state, including poorer districts.""i think we are a proof point of what's possible,"" said mitchell d. chester, the state education commissioner .on a sunny day in may, fifth graders at donald e. ross elementary school here were gathered at an outdoor gazebo, learning about fulcrums by using a ruler set up like a seesaw and balancing weights at both ends.at south middle school, seventh graders in a science class worked in small groups to brainstorm how a box of items — a plastic jar, beaker, water, and a mix of sand, soil, clay and pebbles — could help answer a question posed by the teacher: how do sediments carried in water get deposited? they devised small experiments and wrote down their observations, and at the end of class each group presented its findings.none of the topics were novel, but they were consistent in their hands-on approach, inviting students to explore and explain. ""much more hands-on than what we ever used to do,"" said dianne d. rees, the district's science director. ""hands-on as much as possible.""braintree, a town of about,000 south of boston, is neither an inner-city area nor a wealthy suburb. ""we're sort of, we used to say, a blue-collar area,"" said william kendall, the director of mathematics and technology for the braintree schools .when dr. kendall arrived in 1973 as a math teacher, the standard approach was talking at the front of the classroom and writing on the blackboard.some children learned well from lectures. others did not. ""and it was o.k. those people don't get it, because only we, the math elite, get it,"" dr. kendall said.back then, one could graduate from high school without ever taking algebra. ""then came ed reform,"" dr. kendall said, ""and now everybody had to learn math.""""ed reform"" was the massachusetts education reform act of, passed by a democratic legislature and signed by a republican governor, william f. weld.the three core components were more money (mostly to the urban schools, ambitious academic standards and a high-stakes test that students had to pass before collecting their high school diplomas. all students were expected to learn algebra before high school .""it was a combination of carrots and sticks,"" said david p. driscoll, deputy education commissioner at the time.also noteworthy was what the reforms did not include. parents were not offered vouchers for private schools . the state did not close poorly performing schools, eliminate tenure for teachers or add merit pay. the reforms did allow for some charter schools, but not many.then the state, by and large, stayed the course.the new achievement test, the massachusetts comprehensive assessment system (mcas for short, was given to 10th graders for the first time in. (the graduation requirement of obtaining an acceptable score on the 10th-grade mcas did not take effect until.)in the small city of chelsea, which borders boston, almost 90 percent of the students come from low-income families and most did not speak english as their first language. on the first mcas, two-thirds of chelsea 10th graders failed math. the science scores were nearly as dismal.two years later, scores in the urban districts showed only glacial improvement. a report from the university of massachusetts at boston concluded that the reforms were not delivering on the promises.",392
business,"frankfurt — whenever germany thrived, so did the rest of europe. but that long-held belief is being questioned by its neighbors, which see evidence that the country is taking off without them.despite berlin's hefty financial support of the euro zone's more beleaguered members in the last few years, the economic crisis has corroded commercial ties between germany and the rest of europe. countries like italy and spain no longer have the purchasing power they once did, and they trade less with germany because of it. greece, the most distressed country in europe, is now little more than a german rounding error. german exports to greece plunged 40 percent from, while germany imported 9 percent less from greece . last year, greece ranked 44th among german trading partners, just behind vietnam .no wonder german companies, cheered on by the government of chancellor angela merkel, have turned their attention to faster-growing places like asia or the united states .""right now it's a decoupling story rather than a helping-hand story,"" said carsten brzeski, a senior economist at the dutch bank ing .it is not simply an economic issue, but a geopolitical one.ms. merkel is running for re- election this month in a campaign in which one of the few debating points is how many more financial handouts germany will give to its weaker neighbors. she has made a conscious effort of building closer ties with bigger and faster-growing markets like china . if the merkel government succeeds in making germany a bigger global player through trade and investment policy, it not only insulates germany from european structural woes but also ensures that it remains a global economic force in its own right.for the rest of the euro zone and the larger european union, however, unity depends on the sustained energy and commitment of germany, the wealthiest and most powerful member. the more that germany sees its long-term interests lying outside europe, the less certain the future of the entire european project.""germany is less willing to play ball,"" said stefano micossi, director general of assonime, an italian business group and research organization . rather than pulling together, he said, european leaders have been ""falling back to mutual mistrust and national solutions.""on tuesday, the organization for economic cooperation and development said that even as germany resumed growth, the euro zone's most vulnerable countries were unlikely to follow until sometime next year. european banks remain weak, the group said, while lending — usually considered a prerequisite for economic growth — continues to decline. the euro zone's economic future remains heavily dependent on germany, the biggest market for products like shoes from italy or ford minivans made in spain. german companies like linde, a large supplier of gases for use in industry and health care, are major employers in southern europe .but linde's big growth this year was in the united states, where sales rose 58 percent in the third quarter, to.6 billion, thanks to the purchase of lincare, a company that supplies oxygen to patients in their homes. the united states has also become a hot market for german companies like voith, a maker of industrial equipment, which said last month that it expected to profit from a new law intended to encourage construction of hydroelectric power plants . voith issued a statement calling the new law ""terrific news"" — no surprise considering that the company is one of the world's largest suppliers of hydropower equipment.in addition, china has become the most important market for volkswagen, which sold.5 million cars there in the first six months of this year, more than in western europe . volkswagen is also putting renewed emphasis on north america . in, it opened a factory in chattanooga, tenn., that contributed to a 10 percent increase in american sales through june from a year earlier.",493
science,"cape canaveral, fla. — an impromptu spacewalk over the weekend seems to have fixed a big ammonia leak at the international space station, nasa said thursday.the ""gusher"" erupted a week ago, prompting the hastiest repair job ever by residents of the orbiting lab. spacewalking astronauts replaced a suspect ammonia pump on saturday, just two days after the trouble arose.nasa is now calling the old, removed pump ""mr. leaky,"" said flight controller anthony vareha.""right now, we're feeling pretty good. we definitely got the big leak,"" vareha said in a nasa broadcast from mission control in houston .vareha said engineers don't know whether the pump replacement also took care of a smaller leak that has plagued the system for years. it will take at least a couple months of monitoring to know the full status.ammonia is used as a coolant in the space station's radiator system.the leak forced one of the station's seven power channels to go offline . nasa hopes to resume normal operations early next week, following computer software updates.one of the spacewalkers, nasa astronaut thomas marshburn, is now back on earth. he returned this week aboard a russian soyuz capsule, ending a five-month mission.the other spacewalker, christopher cassidy, a recent arrival, spent thursday chatting with three of the actors and a writer-producer of the newest star trek movie, "" star trek into darkness ."" the film was beamed up to the space station a few days before its u.s. opening in theaters thursday.cassidy watched the first half-hour of the movie while he was exercising thursday morning and offered a stellar review.""i was riveted as you're racing through the woods and jumping off cliffs,"" he told the actors. ""i won't spoil the rest of the movie for anybody who hasn't seen it. but pretty cool scenes.""",92
