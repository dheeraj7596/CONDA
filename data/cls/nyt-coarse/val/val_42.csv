arts,"since its founding 30 years ago, harlem stage has burnished its reputation by presenting innovative artists like bill t. jones and vijay iyer and plumbing social issues . now, the theater is betting that ""makandal"" — its first opera commission and an ambitious, contemporary work revolving around the leader of an 18th-century slave revolt in haiti — will raise its international profile and win it respect as a producer. but the group faces large hurdles.for starters, harlem stage still needs to raise about,000 for its plan to produce and tour the multimedia opera in the united states, haiti and south africa once it has its premiere next fall at the company's 196-seat performing-arts center, called the gatehouse, at 135th street and convent avenue in hamilton heights. while harlem stage's works have traveled before, it has never before taken sole responsibility for producing and touring. there are also a host of practical considerations in transferring the two-hour opera's video projections, animation and lighting to places like a park in port-au-prince .still, patricia cruz, harlem stage's executive director, views ""makandal"" as an opportunity to attract new financers and producing partners for the organization, which has an annual operating budget of around $3 million . and between the upheaval in egypt, immigration debates and the fallout over the killing of trayvon martin, she said the times were right to use the escaped slave and rebel françois makandal to explore questions about immigration, race and liberation .""it is super-ambitious,"" ms. cruz said of the project. ""in order to advance our work and the artists we present, we need to do more — not just in the harlem community or just in new york."" she said the opera form allows its creators ""to mix the mythic, the historic and contemporary tragedies with the idea of hope and the idea of change.""""makandal"" was five years in the making. it was conceived and written by carl hancock rux, who is also a performance artist . his work includes the play ""talk,"" and he originated the title role in robert wilson and bernice johnson reagon's opera, ""the temptation of st . anthony."" the director is lars jan, a genre-bending media artist. jazz, classical and traditional afro-cuban music ripple through the score, written by yosvany terry, a composer born in cuba. edouard duval-carri, the visual designer whose politically charged art is featured in the opera, was born in port-au-prince .with nine actors (all trained singers) playing multiple roles, ""makandal"" also tells the contemporary story of a boatload of cuban, dominican and haitian immigrants embarking on a boat ride to a better life. it is a layered story: in the center is the tale of makandal, a slave who escapes a haitian plantation, hides out in the hills, leads a group of revolutionaries plotting an overthrow of colonial powers and is captured and burned alive at the stake in the public square in cap-haïtien in. ""makandal"" is not strictly biographical, though, as it shifts between myth and reality, the past and the present.harlem stage officials say the opera project is well on its way. performance spaces in both south africa and haiti are in the pipeline, although ms. cruz declined to name them. a ""making makandal"" marketing and fund-raising campaign will begin in september, with events like films, readings and concerts leading up to the premiere, for which no date has been set. one-third of the approximately,000 needed has already been raised from individual donors, corporations and foundations.""i think it's within their capacity,"" said sandra l. gibson, an arts consultant and former president of the association of performing arts presenters, with,000 members worldwide. ""these global cultural exchanges are not just the province of larger institutions . we found from our research that three-fourths of the field has been engaged in global cultural exchange . the size of your entity is not a factor; it was your community, your interest, your mission and your capacity to do this.""there is little downside to ""makandal"" even if it does not reach all of its goals, said michael m. kaiser, the president of the john f. kennedy center for the performing arts and the founder of the center's devos institute of arts management. ""the next time, you come back with a different project,"" mr. kaiser said, building a reputation that does not rely on one hit or miss but a steady series of exciting ventures .for mr. rux, the opera grew out of his three-year residency at what is now called the adrienne arsht center for the performing arts of miami-dade county, which started in.",282
science,"braintree, mass. — conventional wisdom and popular perception hold that american students are falling further and further behind in science and math achievement. the statistics from this state tell a different story.if massachusetts were a country, its eighth graders would rank second in the world in science, behind only singapore, according to timss — the trends in international mathematics and science study, which surveys knowledge and skills of fourth and eighth graders around the world. (the most recent version, in, tested more than,000 students in 63 nations .) massachusetts eighth graders also did well in mathematics, coming in sixth, behind korea, singapore, taiwan, hong kong and japan . the united states as a whole came in 10th in science and 9th in math, with scores that were above the international average.of course, timss is only one test, and achievement tests are incomplete indicators of educational prowess. but behind massachusetts' raw numbers are two decades of sustained efforts to lift science and mathematics education . educators and officials chose a course and held to it, even when the early results were deeply disappointing.while massachusetts has a richer and better-educated population than most states, it is not uniformly wealthy. the gains reflected improvement across the state, including poorer districts.""i think we are a proof point of what's possible,"" said mitchell d. chester, the state education commissioner .on a sunny day in may, fifth graders at donald e. ross elementary school here were gathered at an outdoor gazebo, learning about fulcrums by using a ruler set up like a seesaw and balancing weights at both ends.at south middle school, seventh graders in a science class worked in small groups to brainstorm how a box of items — a plastic jar, beaker, water, and a mix of sand, soil, clay and pebbles — could help answer a question posed by the teacher: how do sediments carried in water get deposited? they devised small experiments and wrote down their observations, and at the end of class each group presented its findings.none of the topics were novel, but they were consistent in their hands-on approach, inviting students to explore and explain. ""much more hands-on than what we ever used to do,"" said dianne d. rees, the district's science director. ""hands-on as much as possible.""braintree, a town of about,000 south of boston, is neither an inner-city area nor a wealthy suburb. ""we're sort of, we used to say, a blue-collar area,"" said william kendall, the director of mathematics and technology for the braintree schools .when dr. kendall arrived in 1973 as a math teacher, the standard approach was talking at the front of the classroom and writing on the blackboard.some children learned well from lectures. others did not. ""and it was o.k. those people don't get it, because only we, the math elite, get it,"" dr. kendall said.back then, one could graduate from high school without ever taking algebra. ""then came ed reform,"" dr. kendall said, ""and now everybody had to learn math.""""ed reform"" was the massachusetts education reform act of, passed by a democratic legislature and signed by a republican governor, william f. weld.the three core components were more money (mostly to the urban schools, ambitious academic standards and a high-stakes test that students had to pass before collecting their high school diplomas. all students were expected to learn algebra before high school .""it was a combination of carrots and sticks,"" said david p. driscoll, deputy education commissioner at the time.also noteworthy was what the reforms did not include. parents were not offered vouchers for private schools . the state did not close poorly performing schools, eliminate tenure for teachers or add merit pay. the reforms did allow for some charter schools, but not many.then the state, by and large, stayed the course.the new achievement test, the massachusetts comprehensive assessment system (mcas for short, was given to 10th graders for the first time in. (the graduation requirement of obtaining an acceptable score on the 10th-grade mcas did not take effect until.)in the small city of chelsea, which borders boston, almost 90 percent of the students come from low-income families and most did not speak english as their first language. on the first mcas, two-thirds of chelsea 10th graders failed math. the science scores were nearly as dismal.two years later, scores in the urban districts showed only glacial improvement. a report from the university of massachusetts at boston concluded that the reforms were not delivering on the promises.",392
business,"as c.e.o. of a fast-growing company, magnet media, i'm really committed to maintaining close relationships with clients . i think that's key to quality service. even though we are proponents about the power of digital marketing, there's still nothing like being in a face-to-face meeting with a client and developing a relationship.i like business trips and i use travel time to collect my thoughts and get a fresh perspective. i like to bring something to read that's inspiring. i don't care if it's fiction, nonfiction or articles that i've downloaded, and i always make sure i have a collection of the latest episodes of my favorite podcasts . to be honest, my favorite part about traveling lately is the opportunity to sleep. i think everyone can relate to that.i do think meeting people face-to-face is important. you never know when you may run into someone you have only talked to a lot on the phone .one of the funniest experiences i had when traveling for business was on a trip to los angeles . my company interviewed a number of filmmakers for a series we were producing for a large film festival . i was watching one of the dvds a filmmaker had given me to screen. the film wasn't released yet, obviously, and i was trying to be discreet about watching it, but the passenger seated next to me kept peering at my laptop. finally, my seatmate looked at me and asked me if i was watching a bootleg copy of the film . i was really offended and explained that the filmmaker gave me the dvd and i needed it for a project. my seatmate then mentioned the filmmaker by name and asked me if i knew her. i thought it was cool that my seatmate was a colleague or fan of this director's work, so i asked him if he had been to the film festival . he smiled and then told me he was actually the festival's director. we had spoken numerous times on the phone . it was a little awkward, and i was a little embarrassed, but at least we had a great face-to-face conversation for the rest of the trip.i've also learned it's important not to judge people when you're traveling. you never know their stories until you ask.i was coming back from thailand, which was one of the most wonderful trips that i've ever taken. it's a long flight and i was looking forward to a lot of quiet time so i could reflect on the trip. of course, i was seated next to a bunch of guys who were being loud. they weren't obnoxious, just annoying, especially since i was looking forward to a quiet flight. it was clear they knew each other and i immediately made the assumption they went to southeast asia to party .i didn't want to make eye contact, but eventually one of the men started talking to me. i'm polite, so i asked him how he and his buddies liked southeast asia .it turns out they were a group of firefighters who brought their e.m.t. training to areas where health care was not easily available. in fact, they had built a whole curriculum around the medical training and were using their vacation days to teach local n.g.o.'s and health care workers how to improve emergency care.i felt like an idiot for judging them. these guys were making the world a better place. i talked with them the rest of the flight about their work, and yes, they were still a little boisterous. but who cares? they were making the world a much better place.",286
politics,"philadelphia — a state judge ruled on monday that a senior catholic official who was sent to prison for his role in a sexual abuse scandal should be released on bail after his conviction for child endangerment was overturned.msgr. william j. lynn, the first senior official of the roman catholic church to be convicted in connection with charges of sexual abuse of children by priests, was granted bail on monday by judge m. teresa sarmina of common pleas court . bail was set at,000, of which monsignor lynn must pay,000 up front. judge sarmina also ordered him to surrender his passport, wear an electronic ankle bracelet and report weekly to law enforcement officials .monsignor lynn, 62, who was not accused of personally abusing children, was convicted in june 2012 on one count of violating a child welfare law by allowing another priest, edward v. avery, to live in church buildings where he abused a boy.as secretary for clergy in the philadelphia archdiocese, monsignor lynn was responsible for investigating claims of sexual abuse by priests. prosecutors claimed at his trial that he had put the reputation of the church ahead of the protection of children, a view supported last week by the appeals court .in reversing the conviction, the pennsylvania superior court ruled that prosecutors had provided ""more than adequate"" evidence that monsignor lynn ""prioritized the archdiocese's reputation over the safety of potential victims of sexually abusive priests."" but it rejected the argument, accepted at the trial, that the child welfare law applied to a ""parent, guardian or other person supervising the welfare of a child"" could be used to prosecute monsignor lynn.monsignor lynn has served about 18 months of a three- to six-year prison sentence . his lawyer, thomas bergstrom, said he was expected to be freed on thursday or friday. he was granted bail pending an appeal to the state supreme court by the philadelphia district attorney's office, which must be filed by late january. defense lawyers argued during the trial that monsignor lynn was not properly charged under the original version of the child welfare law, which applied only to direct caretakers like parents or guardians. the law was updated to cover supervisors in, after the monsignor left his post. judge sarmina, who presided over monsignor lynn's trial, said on monday that she had given the case careful consideration in light of the appeals court's ruling . ""i may have got it wrong,"" she said in a statement at the start of the bail hearing . ""after all, i'm fallible. if the conviction is in question, is not the punishment in question?""hugh burns, the head of the appeals unit at the philadelphia district attorney's office, opposed bail, arguing that the superior court's ruling could be reversed and that it was unusual for defendants convicted of felonies to be freed while their cases are under appeal. district attorney r. seth williams said he was ""disgusted"" by the superior court ruling . "" judge sarmina was correct when she said that monsignor lynn enabled monsters in clerical garb to destroy the souls of children,"" mr. williams said.he said the trial verdict was ""legally sound,"" and he accused the superior court of failing to follow a 1976 ruling by the pennsylvania supreme court that the law under which monsignor lynn was convicted was to be applied for ""broad protective purposes.""the survivors network of those abused by priests said it was disappointed by the bail decision and urged the state supreme court to reinstate the conviction.judy miller, who leads the group's delaware chapter, urged the archdiocese not to reinstate monsignor lynn. ms. miller handed out pamphlets containing the group's demands to catholics emerging from a sunday morning mass at the cathedral basilica of ss. peter and paul in central philadelphia .""monsignor lynn represents thousands of catholic officials across this country and around the world who have knowingly endangered children,"" ms. miller said. ""they have protected criminals and their reputation, and not protected children that were placed in their care.""kenneth gavin, a spokesman for the archdiocese, declined to say whether monsignor lynn could return to ministry.""it's too early in the process to comment definitively about a possible assignment in active ministry,"" mr. gavin wrote in an email.",281
business,"boeing has developed possible fixes for the battery problems in its grounded 787 jets and could have them back in the air within two months, industry and federal officials said wednesday.the officials said boeing has narrowed down the ways the lithium-ion batteries on the jetliners could fail, and believes that adding insulation between the cells of the batteries and making other changes would provide enough assurance that they would be safe to use.raymond l. conner, the president of boeing's commercial airplane division, plans to propose the fixes in a friday meeting with michael p. huerta, the head of the federal aviation administration . mr. huerta is not expected to approve the changes immediately, but the meeting is likely to start a high-level discussion on the standards boeing needs to meet as it tests the fixes and seeks to get the planes flying again.boeing's plan could be a pivotal moment in the history of the innovative fuel-efficient planes. mr. huerta and regulators around the world grounded the planes in mid-january after a battery caught fire on one jet parked at the boston airport and smoke forced another 787 to make an emergency landing in japan . investigators have not determined what caused those problems. but boeing's engineers have worked closely with the f.a.a. and outside experts to identify ways in which the batteries could have failed, and boeing is now asking the government to sign off on a calculation that they have now come up with a safer design.given the risks in moving ahead, federal officials said, the f.a.a. has insisted behind the scenes that boeing needed to come up with changes to prevent failures at the same time as it proposed further steps to wall off problems with the batteries and vent any smoke or fire outside the planes. boeing officials said they had also hoped to make all the fixes at once rather than dividing them into temporary and longer-term changes. by delaying some changes, boeing could have been exposed to more problems.as a result, one big change under boeing's plan would be to redesign the batteries to place insulation inside and around each of the eight cells to minimize the risk that a short circuit or fire in one of the cells could spread to the others, as investigators have said occurred on the battery that caught fire in boston on jan. 7. boeing might also adjust how tightly the batteries are packed.boeing would make other changes within the batteries to reduce the chance that vibrations, swelling or moisture could cause problems, industry officials said. boeing has already been testing some of the changes. the plane maker believes it could rebuild the batteries by next month on the 50 jets that have been delivered to airlines. but federal officials are likely to move more slowly and demand more tests and assurances, and the final decision could rest with mr. huerta's supervisors at the transportation department . federal officials said that if the fixes check out, the jets could start flying again by april. boeing will also have to win back the confidence of the flying public.besides taking more steps to prevent short circuits from occurring, boeing's plan would enclose the battery within a sturdier metal container and create tubes to vent any hazardous materials outside the plane. it would add systems to monitor the activity inside each cell instead of just the battery as a whole.industry officials said there is enough space in the electronics bay to expand the container and add the vent tubes.until now, regulators have focused on the need to pin down the cause of the battery problems . but investigators, now weeks into their work, have been able to find only limited clues in the charred remains of the batteries in the boston and japan incidents.the lithium-ion batteries weigh less but provide more energy than conventional batteries, and the 787s make greater use of them than other planes. the stakes are substantial for boeing, which will have to pay penalties to some of the airlines that have been unable to use them. boeing also cannot deliver more of the planes while they are grounded.the company has orders for 800 additional planes. the jets rely as well on lightweight carbon composites and more efficient engines.boeing awarded the contract for the batteries to gs yuasa, a japanese firm, in, and it won approval from the f.a.a. to use the batteries in. concerned about fires with smaller lithium-ion batteries in cellphones and laptops, the agency placed special conditions on boeing's use of the batteries that required containment and venting measures that have proved inadequate.advances in research have contributed to a better understanding of the risks since then. but boeing, which was consumed with problems with other parts that delayed the introduction of the 787s by several years, did not significantly update the battery designs before it began delivering the planes in. so boeing's plan to fix the problems also amounts to a belated incorporation of what has been learned about how to handle the risks.",39

""you just know that things are going to work out.""owner zygi wilf declined to comment about a decision on frazier, who has one season left on his contract. general manager rick spielman was mum, too.the lions held calvin johnson out because of a nagging knee injury . matthew stafford stopped his turnover streak and completed 22 of 33 passes for 217 yards and a third-quarter touchdown pass to bush, but the lions finished 7-24 at this stadium, which was inflated in. they finished the year with six losses in their last seven games despite holding a fourth-quarter lead in all of them, putting coach jim schwartz on the metaphorical hot seat, too.""it's definitely been very rocky, and it's not been easy to deal with,"" said running back reggie bush . ""it's been an emotional roller coaster, going from being in first place to where we are now, that's not how you want to end the season.""schwartz fell to 29-52 over five full years. both he and frazier have made the playoffs once.""we can't worry about decisions we don't make,"" schwartz said, adding: ""i'd certainly like to be back. i think we have unfinished business here. we've come a long way in these years, but we still have some ground that we can make and i'm anxious to have a chance to do that.""there will be no more business in this building, which will be torn down next month to make room for a new domed venue on the same site. the vikings will play outside the next two seasons at the university of minnesota's facility.""i love the stadium. but when you see the pictures of the new one, you're anxious and excited to get into the new one,"" said peterson, who was held out due to a sprained foot. he set the nfl's all-time single-game rushing record here in 2007 with 296 yards .third-stringer matt asiata filled in with 14 carries for 115 yards . jared allen had two sacks to pass the double-digit mark for the seventh straight season. cassel had the winning touchdown throw. he was the quarterback at the end of all five vikings victories this year, two in injury relief of christian ponder . the vikings also narrowly avoided setting a franchise record for most points allowed, leaving the 1984 team still holding that dubious mark.this still might not have been enough to save frazier's job, however.""i enjoyed playing for leslie. he came in each and every day with a demeanor to try to get this team ready to play, and i respect that about him and how he went about his business . there never was anybody, especially in his case, hanging his head when things didn't go our way,"" cassel said.patterson wasn't ready for the opening kickoff, slapping the goalpost and trying to fire up fans behind him when the ball sailed in the end zone . chase ford caught it for a touchback. patterson quickly refocused, though.late in the first quarter, he took a pitch in the backfield, immediately reversed course and ran right toward the sideline. he slipped between ndamukong suh and devin taylor, then snaked his way through the rest of the defense for a 50-yard gain, the longest rushing play in vikings history by a wide receiver .notes: patterson finished his rookie year with nine tds, including six in the last five games. ... bush and fellow rb joique bell each finished with 500-plus yards receiving . they combined for,709 yards and 15 tds.",204
business,"london — as an island nation that once built an empire by sea, britain has a proud history and longstanding expertise in shipbuilding.but, buffeted by cuts in military spending and a decline in demand, the country's biggest military contractor, bae systems, said on wednesday that it would end more than five centuries of shipbuilding in the southern english city of portsmouth and cut nearly,800 jobs across britain.the announcement prompted opponents of prime minister david cameron to accuse him of playing politics with an industry intertwined with the country's history.the company is finishing a large order worth several billion pounds to build two aircraft carriers, which had created the largest shipbuilding boom for the company since world war ii, by some measures. with that order coming to an end, layoffs had been expected. but the scale of the cuts, worked out in a restructuring plan with the government, came as a surprise.about 940 shipbuilding jobs will be lost in portsmouth by the end of next year. that will reduce a port with a history that dates to the building of 16th-century warships like henry viii's mary rose to a backwater in which only ship maintenance and servicing will be done. an additional 835 positions will be eliminated in filton, near bristol in the southwest of england, and glasgow and rosyth in scotland.mr. cameron tried to cast the cuts in a semi-positive light. ""in portsmouth, yes, there will be job reductions,"" he said, ""but there are many more people involved in ship servicing than in shipbuilding.""the government said it would invest £100 million, or $161 million, in an expanded dock in portsmouth, which will become home to the two new aircraft carriers, h.m.s. queen elizabeth and h.m.s. prince of wales.the biggest political backlash could come from the fact that bae is not only shutting down shipbuilding operations in portsmouth, but also intends to move some of its shipmaking capacity to scotland. the company said on wednesday that glasgow was the best location to build a new fleet of type 26 frigates . that contract is the company's next big order.coming a year ahead of a referendum on scottish independence, the announcement prompted lawmakers in the opposition and labor unions in england to accuse the conservative government of trading english jobs for scottish ones in an attempt to persuade scotland not to secede.in an animated exchange in the house of commons on wednesday, the labour party's new spokesman for military issues, vernon coaker, challenged defense minister philip hammond, questioning whether he was acting in britain's national interest.""what safeguards are in place if scotland votes to leave the u.k.?"" he asked. ""none of us wants to see that, but we need to know what plans he has in place for all eventualities.""mr. hammond said, ""we have a sustainable naval shipbuilding industry in the u.k. — as of this announcement.""but even some conservatives were uneasy. asked whether she believed that english jobs were being sacrificed for scottish jobs, caroline dinenage, a conservative lawmaker for gosport in hampshire, did not hesitate. ""yes, definitely,"" she said on bbc radio.the most passionate rebukes came from portsmouth, where shipbuilding is what wine production is to much of france and auto manufacturing is to detroit : a cultural identity as much as an industry.""portsmouth is the last place in england that has the ability to build advanced warships for the royal navy,"" said gerald vernon-jackson, the leader of portsmouth city council . he said that if scotland left britain, the royal navy might ""have to buy ships from france or germany.""david hulse, chairman of the confederation of shipbuilding and engineering unions' national shipbuilding committee, called it ""a devastating day for the u.k. shipbuilding industry.""an additional,200 bae workers employed in maintaining and servicing ships at the naval base in portsmouth will not be affected by the cuts.",258
science,"scientists have found the oldest dna evidence yet of humans' biological history. but instead of neatly clarifying human evolution, the finding is adding new mysteries.in a paper in the journal nature, scientists reported wednesday that they had retrieved ancient human dna from a fossil dating back about,000 years, shattering the previous record of,000 years.the fossil, a thigh bone found in spain, had previously seemed to many experts to belong to a forerunner of neanderthals. but its dna tells a very different story. it most closely resembles dna from an enigmatic lineage of humans known as denisovans. until now, denisovans were known only from dna retrieved from,000-year-old remains in siberia, 4,000 miles east of where the new dna was found.the mismatch between the anatomical and genetic evidence surprised the scientists, who are now rethinking human evolution over the past few hundred thousand years. it is possible, for example, that there are many extinct human populations that scientists have yet to discover. they might have interbred, swapping dna. scientists hope that further studies of extremely ancient human dna will clarify the mystery.""right now, we've basically generated a big question mark,"" said matthias meyer, a geneticist at the max planck institute for evolutionary anthropology in leipzig, germany, and a co-author of the new study.hints at new hidden complexities in the human story came from a,000-year-old femur found in a cave in spain called sima de los huesos (""the pit of bones"" in spanish. the scientific team used new methods to extract the ancient dna from the fossil.""this would not have been possible even a year ago,"" said juan luis arsuaga, a paleoanthropologist at universidad complutense de madrid and a co-author of the paper.finding such ancient human dna was a major advance, said david reich, a geneticist at harvard medical school who was not involved in the research. ""that's an amazing, game-changing thing,"" he said.since the 1970s, spanish scientists have brought out a wealth of fossils from the cave dating back hundreds of thousands of years. ""the place is very special,"" said dr. arsuaga, who has found 28 nearly complete skeletons of humans during three decades of excavations.based on the anatomy of the fossils, dr. arsuaga has argued that they belonged to ancestors of neanderthals, which lived in western asia and europe from about,000 to,000 years ago .when dr. meyer and his colleagues drilled into the femur, they found ancient human dna inside, just as they had hoped.""our expectation was that it would be a very early neanderthal,"" dr. meyer said.but the dna did not match that of neanderthals. dr. meyer then compared it to the dna of the denisovans, the ancient human lineage that he and his colleagues had discovered in siberia in. he was shocked to find that it was similar.""everybody had a hard time believing it at first,"" dr. meyer said. ""so we generated more and more data to nail it down.""the extra research confirmed that the dna belonged on the denisovan branch of the human family tree .the new finding is hard to reconcile with the picture of human evolution that has been emerging based on fossils and ancient dna. denisovans were believed to be limited to east asia, and they were not thought to look so neanderthal-like.based on previously discovered ancient dna and fossil evidence, scientists generally agreed that humans' direct ancestors shared a common ancestor with neanderthals and denisovans that lived about half a million years ago in africa.their shared ancestors split off from humans' lineage and left africa, then split further into the denisovans and neanderthals about,000 years ago . the evidence suggested that neanderthals headed west, toward europe, and that the denisovans moved east.humans' ancestors, meanwhile, stayed in africa, giving rise to homo sapiens about,000 years ago . humans then expanded from africa into asia and europe about,000 years ago . they then interbred not only with neanderthals, but with denisovans, too. later, both the denisovans and neanderthals became extinct.""now we have to rethink the whole story,"" dr. arsuaga said.dr. arsuaga doubts that denisovans were spread out across so much of the old world, from spain to siberia, masquerading as neanderthals.one alternative explanation is that the humans of sima de los huesos were not true neanderthals, but belonged to the ancestors of both denisovans and neanderthals.it is also possible that the newly discovered dna was passed to both neanderthals and denisovans, but eventually disappeared from neanderthals, replaced by other variants.""it got lost in one lineage but made its way in the other,"" suggested jean-jacques hublin, a max planck paleoanthropologist who was not involved in the research.beth shapiro, an expert on ancient dna at the university of california, santa cruz, favors an even more radical possibility: that the humans of sima de los huesos belong to yet another branch of humans. they might have been a species called homo erectus, which originated about.8 million years ago and became extinct within the last few hundred thousand years.""the more we learn from the dna extracted from these fossils, the more complicated the story becomes,"" dr. shapiro said.this complicated story has come to light only because of advances over the past 20 years in retrieving ancient dna.when an organism dies, its dna breaks down into smaller and smaller fragments, while also becoming contaminated with the dna of other species like soil bacteria. so piecing the fossil dna together is a bit like putting together a jigsaw puzzle created by a sadist.in, svante paabo of the max planck institute and his colleagues, who had pioneered the techniques for retrieving dna fragments, published a snippet of dna from a neanderthal fossil dating back about,000 years. they and other scientists then built on this success by searching for bits of dna from other neanderthals.in, a team of french and belgian researchers obtained a fragment of neanderthal dna dating back,000 years, which until now held the record for the oldest human dna ever found.meanwhile, using improved methods, dr. paabo, dr. meyer and their colleagues assembled a rough draft of the entire neanderthal genome in.that discovery shed light on how neanderthals and humans' ancestors split from a common ancestor hundreds of thousands of years ago . it also revealed that neanderthals and humans interbred about,000 years ago .around the same time as that discovery, russian collaborators sent the max planck team,000-year-old fossils they had found in a cave in siberia called denisova. when the german scientists sequenced the entire genome from the finger bone of a girl, it turned out to be neither human nor neanderthal, but from a separate lineage, which dr. paabo and his colleagues named denisovans.dr. meyer is hopeful that he and his colleagues will be able to get more dna from the spanish fossil, as well as other fossils from the site, to help solve the puzzle they have now stumbled across. ""it's extremely hard to make sense of,"" dr. meyer said. ""we still are a bit lost here.""",306
sports,"greenburgh, n.y. — raymond felton was a spectator for most of monday's practice. he sat on a training table next to tyson chandler, whose fractured right leg was no longer encased in a protective boot. this counted as progress for the knicks, whose training facility has doubled as a sanitarium this season. felton, the starting point guard, took the day off from contact drills as he continued to recover from a strained left hamstring . the injury has hindered him since the preseason. his shooting touch has been jagged. his defense has been worse, with opposing guards treating him like a bright orange traffic cone.""there are certain shots that i'm used to taking and making that just aren't falling,"" felton said. ""and there are certain lateral movements that i can't make on defense. it's just not there. and it's frustrating. i'm fighting through it."" felton, who is averaging.1 points a game and shooting.6 percent from the field, has also been dealing with what he described as a pinched nerve in his hip, which sends a ""sharp pain"" shooting down his legs, he said. he has taken medication in an attempt to ease some of the symptoms.""nobody's known about that, because i don't like making excuses,"" he said. ""but hopefully, the treatment kicks in, and we'll see how it goes.""with trade talk swirling and the pressure to win mounting, the knicks (3-6) might be leaving town at an opportune time. five of their next six games will be on the road, starting tuesday night against the detroit pistons . the knicks have been dreadful at madison square garden, where they have lost five straight .on monday, coach mike woodson again questioned his team's effort. he can excuse missed shots, he said. he cannot justify an absence of focus.""not good enough,"" he said. ""i'm not here to teach effort, and i think our players understand that.""for felton, 29, the opening weeks of the season have been a slog. he injured his hamstring in a preseason game against the washington wizards on oct. 17, and then had the muscle tighten in the regular-season opener against the milwaukee bucks on oct. 30.his play has suffered. his points per possession, a measure of offensive efficiency, are.746 over all and an anemic.672 in half- court sets, which ranks in the league's 17th percentile, according to synergy sports. he is shooting.7 percent in fourth quarters, an indication of fatigue. felton has never been mistaken for the second coming of bill bradley. for his career, felton is a.3 percent shooter. his conditioning has occasionally been cause for concern, particularly when he played for the portland trail blazers in.still, felton has seldom been quite so ineffective as a scorer — or as a defender. opposing guards are scoring.3 points per 48 minutes against him, according to 82games.com. last thursday, he was outplayed by the houston rockets' jeremy lin, who collected 21 points, 5 rebounds and 3 assists in a 109-106 win. felton finished with 8 points and 7 assists in 41 minutes. the game underscored the knicks' decision to let the 25-year-old lin leave as a free agent two summers ago . felton has acknowledged that he has not played well. but unless woodson gives more minutes to pablo prigioni or beno udrih, felton will continue to play — and play a lot. woodson voiced his support for felton last week when he was asked if there was an ideal type of point guard to bring out the best in carmelo anthony . "" raymond felton,"" woodson said.ivorie manning, a las vegas -based shooting coach who has worked with felton, said he called felton last week to see if he wanted to meet. manning said he could sense that felton was playing under stress.""he just said, 'i'm not making any excuses, but my hamstring is killing me,' "" manning said in a telephone interview . ""i can tell. with me being here in town, and us not going to the gym last night, that tells me what kind of state he's in. i know how much he likes to work, but he just wants to rest at this point. ray is not one to rest.""a large part of felton's game, manning said, is predicated on his ability to get into the lane. once there, felton has two options. if he draws defenders, he can pass the ball to an open teammate under the basket. or, if he has the space, he can come to a jump stop and launch a short floater. in recent weeks, though, both options have been limited, manning said. with chandler sidelined, felton has been operating without a reliable post presence if he penetrates and the defense collapses. and because his plant leg is injured, felton is missing his usual explosion when he does shoot. he has converted only half his attempts within five feet of the basket.""the last thing you want to do when you have a hamstring injury is come to a quick stop and shoot,"" manning said.as a result, felton has settled for more outside jumpers, with 34 of his 109 field-goal attempts coming from 3-point range .this has not been an especially sound strategy for felton, who has made seven of them, or.6 percent.""the lift is not there,"" felton said. ""but no excuses. i've got to figure it out."" metta world peace, who did not practice monday because of a sore left knee, will not make the trip. he was also mourning the death of a family member, mike woodson said. ... center jeremy tyler could join the erie bayhawks, the knicks' development league affiliate, by wednesday, according to ivorie manning, who has been working with him.",11
sports,"before every kickoff at doak campbell stadium in tallahassee, fla., a florida state student in facial war paint and an american indian costume steers a spotted appaloosa to midfield. as the horse rises on its hind legs, the rider, who is not an indian, thrusts a flaming spear into the turf to the crazed accompaniment of the crowd's droning chant and an arm gesture called the tomahawk chop.saturday will be different, though, but not because a nationwide debate is swirling around the washington redskins' nickname or because some universities have re-examined their depiction of native american culture.remaining unimpeachable, a 35-year ritual at seminoles football games will merely be tweaked so the fiery weapon can be handed off and flung by the former coach bobby bowden.there will probably not be a peep of protest .the seminole tribe of florida has granted written permission for the university to borrow symbols of its heritage. while other tribes have pressed institutions to amend certain traditions or abandon nicknames and logos, florida state enjoys the imprimatur of its sports teams' namesake.""we seminoles embrace that mascot,"" chief james billie, the tribe's chairman, said. ""they honor us."" florida state students voted on the nickname in, when the all-women college became coeducational and started a football program. (other nominees included golden falcons, indians and crackers.)the pregame theater featuring the characters renegade ( horse ) and osceola (human) was introduced in, recalling a phase of history both meaningful and painful to indians . within a few years, the routine had ignited enough objections, primarily from civil rights and indian activist groups, that the university pondered discarding it.""there was pressure to change the nickname,"" said dale lick, f.s.u.'s president in the early 1990s. ""it was substantial.""the tribe's endorsement during meetings with lick was all that florida state needed to retain the images, even though the more distant seminole nation of oklahoma was not as enthusiastic.""had chief billie and his leadership gone in another direction,"" lick said, ""we might have changed it.""in return, the university has provided scholarships and cut-rate tuition for tribe members. dr. patricia wickman, who attended the meetings as the tribe's director of anthropology and genealogy, urged billie to seek 1 percent of revenue generated by the nickname, like money from souvenir sales.""he looked at me like i was crazy,"" said wickman, now a consultant to the tribe.billie explained, ""we enjoy the games, so we're not begging for anything.""billie occasionally attends games but prefers to watch on tv with his family. to billie, who was restored by tribal vote to the chairman position in 2011 after being impeached eight years earlier, the florida state community serves as an extended family to the tribe, which has a population of more than,000.evidence of the tribe's support extends to the splashes of garnet and gold, florida state's colors, on the tribe's gymnasium and elsewhere at its reservation in south florida .""as long as they're winning, we're together,"" billie likes to say, mostly as a joke.the seminoles' football team is winning. led by the redshirt freshman quarterback jameis winston, florida state is no. 2 in this season's first bowl championship series rankings and is 6-0 for the first time since, the last season the team won a national championship .the tribe feels some ownership of the ceremony at florida state home games. osceola's garb and makeup were altered with the tribe's input. although the university's pregame custom has met with criticism that it can conjure a stereotype of indians in battle, the seminole hierarchy approves of it.regarding opposition from american indians outside florida, billie summons the notion of tribal self-determination, with each indian people setting its own course.""we tell them to go back to their own territory,"" he said. ""leave us alone. this is my place, my home.""f.s.u. has been able to dig in its heels with backing from bodies of influence that go beyond the tribe.in, the state senate unanimously passed a bill that would have compelled the university to use the nickname. the house took no action, and the bill expired.",135
sports,"parker, colo. — one day later, one hole further down the golf course, solheim cup rules officials found themselves in another drawn-out dispute over where to drop balls that flew into a hazard.saturday's row, which european captains timed at 31 minutes, came on the par-5 16th and involved american cristie kerr and europe's beatriz recari, both of whom teed off into the hazard that separates the split fairways on the 532-yard hole.the sides couldn't reach agreement on where either drop should come. the bigger problem appeared to be deciding where recari's shot entered the hazard.lpga tour official brad alexander, who admitted rules officials had erred in the protracted case involving europe's carlota ciganda on no. 15 the day before, watched replays on tv and came out to the course but that didn't offer any quick resolution.after recari finally dropped, she hit her third shot onto the green and had a 25- foot putt to close the match. she missed and the players moved to 18 before the europeans closed out a 1-up victory and a sweep of the best-ball matches, courtesy of karin icher's 45- foot putt from off the fringe.still miffed at the prolonged argument long after the match was over, recari gave a detailed explanation. her version: three spotters said they saw the ball bounce on the ground and cross the line of the hazard. the americans, meanwhile, heard recari shouting at the ball to ""get right,"" which suggested to them it was over the hazard the entire time and never hit the ground .""bottom line, they won the hole,"" recari said. ""i mean, we have to be adults. ... if it's inconclusive, we have to come to agreement. that was the argument for 31 minutes, the referee and all of us trying to figure it out. and we went back and forth.""one major difference between the friday and saturday disputes: america had no momentum to lose, the way it did when stacy lewis and lexi thompson got held up for nearly a half-hour on the 15th hole while officials figured out where ciganda should drop.ciganda got up and down to save par en route to a victory on friday. recari's drop wound up making no difference in the match, but europe still walked away with the win and the 10 ½-5 ½ lead heading into sunday singles.""it took forever, it was a mess, and it made everybody a little frazzled,"" kerr said. ""and i mean, really, where my ball crossed, it kind of wasn't a question. but we were just trying to get it right. and we had to go to tv, and that took forever. and then the fans got anxious and it was weird.""the new spanish armada: carlota ciganda looked like a different player saturday than she did in her solheim cup debut.""i met carlota when she was 8 and i was,"" munoz said. ""and every time, in the spanish team, we always play the foursomes together. and ever since i can remember, we are best friends.""ciganda made the 12- foot birdie putt to clinch a 1-up victory over angela stanford and gerina pillar and close out a day that was much different from her opening match . she and suzann pettersen won that match, in large part because ciganda got a favorable — and incorrect — ruling about where to drop on the 15th hole, then got up-and-down for a par.but she was all over the place on friday, playing from the scrub and weeds through most of the back nine.on saturday, with munoz by her side, it was a much different story.cigada made the first of four birdies on no. 2 and, of course, saved the best one for last — after curling a 7-iron close on the uphill 18th.""today it was like playing just a normal event like we used to in spain or even in europe,"" ciganda said. ""so i trust her and i think she trusts me, too.""heated moment: paula creamer and lexi thompson were involved in an argument on the seventh green when charley hull and jodi ewart-shadoff conceded creamer's par putt after creamer had lined it up and was ready to make the stroke.europe already had a birdie and creamer's putt for par was on the same line as her partner, who had a birdie putt to halve the hole.as creamer was getting ready to putt, european assistant captain annika sorenstam shouted that her team should concede the putt. ewart-shadoff's caddie then told creamer, ""that's good.""the europeans didn't want to give thompson a free look at the line. under the rules of golf, when they conceded creamer's putt, she wasn't allowed to make the stroke because it would assist her partner.an argument ensued, and shortly afterward, thompson made her putt anyway, accentuating it with a big fist pump. it drew the match to even, but the americans ended up losing, 2 down."" things happen out there,"" creamer said. ""it's an unfortunate thing. i think you should kind of know the rules of match play, for sure, when you're out there, but at the same time, jodi and charley apologized for what happened.""american captain meg mallon said solheim cup officials spoke with usga officials, who said sorenstam's directive didn't count as ""advice,"" and therefore didn't violate a rule that allows only head captains to advise the players. ewart-shadoff said it was much ado about nothing, given that thompson made the putt.""we kind of were unsure about what the rule was about playing out when we had already made the birdie,"" she said. ""at the end of the day, they made the putt and there's nothing really to say about it.""short shots: giulia sergas was the only european to only play one match over the first two days. ... americans who haven't tallied a point yet: lexi thompson, gerina pillar and angela stanford, who is on a six-match losing streak . ... by splitting her matches saturday, michelle wie moved to 5-1-1 lifetime when playing as a captain's pick.",119
arts,"it has taken frederick wiseman 45 years to get from high school to college. the master filmmaker's latest portrait of an institution, ""at berkeley,"" centers on the university of california in berkeley and joins an extraordinary résumé that stretches back to "" high school "" in 1968 and his controversial debut, ""titicut follies,"" in. in between, mr. wiseman has established himself as one of america's greatest chroniclers in any medium.""what i'm interested in is making movies about as many different subjects as i can, and as many different forms of human experience,"" mr. wiseman, indefatigable at, said in a phone conversation during his summer break in maine .his output seems to have matched his ambition. ""at berkeley,"" his 40th feature, will have its world premiere on sept. 2 at the venice film festival . it joins a cinematic panorama of subjects whose understated titles belie their depth: "" basic training,"" ""welfare,"" ""meat"" (meatpacking plants, ""the store,"" ""boxing gym,"" ""ballet,"" ""deaf"" (special-needs school, ""belfast, maine ."" the richly observed films are sprawling and intimate, dense with the raw material of human endeavor and discourse, and free from the ready-made storylines and messaging of mainstream documentary, much less voiceover.in ""at berkeley,"" we witness the autumn 2010 semester at a university in crisis, yet thriving. mr. wiseman uses the institution's settings — the meetings, classes and protests — as stages to play out its multifaceted drama of people and ideas. a student's tears at a financial aid session turn the moment into a portrait of middle-class america on the ropes. budget meetings show the struggle to maintain the values of public education, and create a profile of a leader in then-chancellor robert birgeneau. a goal is scored in a field hockey game . former secretary of labor robert reich in a lecture makes an example out of a valued former aide who was unafraid to criticize him. and — this is berkeley — a reading room is occupied by the latest generation of student activists .""i deliberately contacted berkeley first,"" mr. wiseman said. ""for two reasons: it's public and it's a great university.""mr. wiseman made his pitch in a letter to mr. birgenau, who promptly invited the filmmaker to visit. by the end of lunch together, the filmmaker had permission to shoot at will — with the exception of tenure discussions — and began production in the autumn of. with the paid assistance of a former chief of staff for chancellors, john cummins, mr. wiseman picked his way through the campus, amassing 250 hours of footage over 12 weeks of shooting.while his recent films, ""boxing gym"" and ""crazy horse,"" are essentially confined to single-building locales, mr. wiseman and john davey, his longtime cameraman, traversed a campus of,232-acres, or about 500 hectares, for ""at berkeley."" its students, faculty, staff and local residents number in the tens of thousands, ""with all the problems of a small city,"" mr. wiseman said. like any good navigator of gatekeepers, the filmmaker cultivated his sources.""secretaries or administrative assistants are always very important people for this kind of a movie, because they know what's going on,"" he said.what was going included budget wrangling after a steady decline in state financing for the university: from 54 percent of the budget in, to 12 percent in, according to the daily californian, the campus newspaper. mr. wiseman said that wasn't why he made the documentary, but berkeley ends up serving as a bellwether for the broader predicament of public institutions under economic pressures and anti-government politicking. while mr. birgeneau has been criticized for his handling of the budget, ""at berkeley"" depicts a delicate balancing act with an eye toward preserving scholarships and teaching standards.mr. wiseman — wry, sharp, and unfailingly precise about what his films do and do not do — is typically reluctant to generalize. but he spoke freely on the threat faced by public universities, and especially the humanities.""there's a political agenda behind that, which is to dumb people down. because if you don't study the humanities and you don't have technical education, you're not going to know about all the questions connected with the enlightenment or free speech or representative government,"" mr. wiseman said, adding, as if to temper his comments: ""blah blah blah.""intellectual and civic engagement are prominent themes in mr. wiseman's films . the meetings and class discussions of ""at berkeley"" are the marketplace of ideas in action, just as his 2007 film "" state legislature "" shows the mundane workings of state government .in his scenes and sequences in ""at berkeley"" and other films, mr. wiseman seeks to do justice to both ""the literal and the abstract,"" resulting in a lengthy, analytical editing process. take, for example, the odd, even comical recurring sight of battle-ready camouflaged reserve officers' training corps students doing drills and lobbing fake grenades on campus. it's at once a reminder of the existence of these programs, of their financial value to campus coffers, of the reach of war even into the groves of the academe.the classes on display, with their ceaseless talk of complex ideas, bring out one of the film's underlying themes.""there's a question of how do you conceptualize with words, and how do you conceptualize with images,"" mr. wiseman said. the filmmaker said he struggled over whether to include one lecture about dark energy, which he could not make heads or tails of. (the lecturer: nobel prize winner saul perlmutter.) ultimately, he saw a value in the experience of disorientation, recalling how he, in ""deaf,"" did not subtitle sign language .as expansive as mr. wiseman's film is, the average observer might still reasonably ask: where's the beer? that is to say, what about student life? we see students walking, lounging, playing field hockey, acting on stage, studying, discussing race, but dormitory life is not in evidence.""one of the reasons i called the movie 'at berkeley' as opposed to 'berkeley' was to suggest that these were all events that took place at berkeley but there was no suggestion that this was 'all' of berkeley,"" mr. wiseman said. his wittiest take on the social scene comes within the film : a student musical number about facebook .mr. wiseman made a point, however, to highlight the campus's diversity. its composition forecasts the future of the country at large, when whites will be a minority and he noted its makeup is far different from his own experience at williams college, where he graduated in."" williams, when i went there, was academically superb and wildly anti-semitic,"" mr. wiseman recalls.

science,"buckets of blickets: children and logic: a game developed by researchers at the university of california, berkeley, hopes to show how imaginative play in children may influence development of abstract thought.other species play, but none play for as much of their lives as humans do, or as imaginatively, or with as much protection from the family circle. human children are unique in using play to explore hypothetical situations rather than to rehearse actual challenges they'll face later. kittens may pretend to be cats fighting, but they will not pretend to be children; children, by contrast, will readily pretend to be cats or kittens — and then to be hannah montana, followed by spider-man saving the day.and in doing so, they develop some of humanity's most consequential faculties. they learn the art, pleasure and power of hypothesis — of imagining new possibilities. and serious students of play believe that this helps make the species great.the idea that play contributes to human success goes back at least a century. but in the last 25 years or so, researchers like elizabeth s. spelke, brian sutton-smith, jaak panksepp and alison gopnik have developed this notion more richly and tied it more closely to both neuroscience and human evolution. they see play as essential not just to individual development, but to humanity's unusual ability to inhabit, exploit and change the environment.dr. gopnik, author of ""the scientist in the crib"" and ""the philosophical baby,"" and a professor of psychology at the university of california, berkeley, has been studying the ways that children learn to assess their environment through play. lately she has focused on the distinction between ""exploring"" new environments and ""exploiting"" them. when we're quite young, we are more willing to explore, she finds; adults are more inclined to exploit.to exploit, one leans heavily on lessons (and often unconscious rules) learned earlier — so-called prior biases. these biases are useful to adults because they save time and reduce error: by going to the restaurant you know is good, instead of the new place across town, you increase the chance that you'll enjoy the evening.most adults are slow to set such biases aside; young children fling them away like bad fruit.dr. gopnik shows this brilliantly with a game she invented with the psychologist david sobel (her student, now a professor at brown. in the game, which has the fetching name blickets, players try to figure out what it is that makes an otherwise undistinguished clay figure a blicket. in some scenarios you can win even if you're applying a prior bias. in others you can't.last summer i joined dr. gopnik behind a wall of one-way glass to watch her lab manager, sophie bridgers, play the game with an extremely alert 5-year-old, esther.seated at a child-size table, esther leaned forward on her elbows to watch as ms. bridgers brought out a small bin of clay shapes and told her that some of them were blickets but most were not.""you cannot tell which ones are blickets by looking at them. but the ones that are blickets have blicketness inside. and luckily,"" ms. bridgers went on, holding up a box with a red plastic top, ""i have my machine. blicketness makes my machine turn on and play music .""it's a ruse, of course. the box responds not to the clay shapes but to a switch under the table controlled by ms. bridgers.now came the challenge. this version of the blicket game, which gopnik developed in collaboration with berkeley colleagues christopher lucas and tom griffiths, can be played by either of two rules, called ""and"" and ""or."" the ""or"" version is easier: when a blicket is placed atop the machine, it will light the machine up whether placed there by itself or with other pieces. it is either a blicket or it isn't; it doesn't depend on the presence of any other object.in the ""and"" trial, however, a blicket reveals its blicketness only if both it and another blicket are placed on the machine; and it will light up the box even if it and the other blicket are accompanied by a non-blicket. it can be harder than it sounds, and this is the game that esther played.first, ms. bridgers put each of three clay shapes on the box individually — rectangle, then triangle, then a bridge. none activated the machine. then she put them on the box in three successive combinations.2. rectangle and bridge: machine lighted up and played a tune!ms. bridgers then picked up each piece in turn and asked esther whether it was a blicket. i had been indulging my adult (and journalistic) prior bias for recorded observation by filling several pages with notes and diagrams, and i started flipping frantically through my notebook.",177
arts,"let it be known that the tough drake era begins not this week, with the release of ""nothing was the same,"" the first official tough drake album, but rather began all the way back on jan. 6, 2012. that day saw the release of the video for ""stay schemin,"" a rick ross song featuring drake and french montana . the clip is a fuzzy michael mann rip-off, nighttime miami reduced to blacks, grays and electric blues, oozing sinister energy .in it, drake dons a black sweatshirt, black jeans, black boots and a gold chain. he spends most of his verse staring hard into the camera, his eyebrows barely moving. he gestures brusquely with a bandanna in his right hand. and he delivers what is easily the most tart, harsh, menacing verse of his career: ""might look light, but we heavy though.""this came not even two months after the release of ""take care,"" drake's masterpiece album of sensitivity and recrimination, and it read like an almost total repudiation of it. that album was a bloodletting of heartbreak and anxieties, while ""stay schemin"" was a firm punch to the jaw that became a staple at the same time as some purple songs from ""take care."" not only was drake writing his own narrative, he was also writing his own counternarrative. it's difficult to tell which of those is now the main plot — both are in play on ""nothing was the same"" (young money /cash money / republic, drake's third excellent major-label album, and the first to come as he is firmly ensconced in hip-hop's top tier .before, he was an interloper effecting seismic change in hip-hop, thanks to his dismantling of the usual facades of acquisitiveness and fearlessness. building on kanye west's template of ambivalence, drake took mr. west's self-examination and stripped it of all its agitation, preserving only the emotional turmoil . he wanted success, and was aware of his more conventional competition, but his concerns were primarily internal.but drake is on top now, the genre's stylistic standard-bearer and its most reliable and versatile hit maker, and his concerns have shifted accordingly. on ""nothing was the same"" drake broods like before, sure, but also puffs his chest in equal measure. he's always used his music to send messages to women who've broken his heart, or whom he just couldn't hold tight enough. now he's got something to lord over them, too.the musical choices are familiar — hazy, often doleful post-soul and low-end-heavy hip-hop, largely moving slowly and with deliberateness. most of the album is produced by drake's longtime associate, who's sticking close to the sound that's become their joint signature. the aching hit ""hold on, we're going home"" recalls ""find your love,"" from; ""pound cake"" is reminiscent of ""dreams money can buy,"" from.the most noticeable change in drake over the last couple of years has been physical, not musical: suddenly he's muscled, full of hard angles. the eyes remain soft, but everything around them has been remade. this is the externalization of the bravado that is now an essential part of his music — he's bragged plenty before, but now it has weight. (it's probably worth mentioning the new york nightclub altercation between drake's crew and chris brown's crew in june; when drake spoke of it in a recent gq interview, he had an ominous air, as if anticipating how things could get worse.)but muscles aside, there's no real physicality to drake's toughness. it's a psychological evolution more than anything, the result of accepting his stature as reality, not just a dream. in the past, laying himself bare has been the most natural thing. but when you're the object of ire and jealousy, the apt response is to flash teeth and snarl a bit.the ""nothing was the same"" tough talk began several months ago with the release of ""started from the bottom"" — like most of drake's opening album singles, it's far more muscular than what appears on the rest of the album. it's rousing and victorious — ""there ain't really much out here that's popping off without us"" — and also a bit malevolent.that was one of several songs, dating back to ""stay schemin,"" in which drake put up his dukes and prepared for a fight: the baleful ""5am in toronto,"" or his verse on the remix to ""versace"" by migos (""this year i'm eating your food and my table got so many plates on it, or the joyful flexing on asap rocky's single, the unprintable title of which shortens to ""problems.""",287
business,"boeing defended the safety of its 787 dreamliner airplane on wednesday after three incidents in three days, saying it had ""extreme confidence"" in the innovative design and technology used in the plane.the 787 has been in operation for 15 months, and boeing has delivered 50 airplanes so far to eight airlines, including all nippon airways, japan airlines and united airlines . since then, a small number of 787s have had electrical fires, fuel leaks or other problems, prompting a safety advisory from federal regulators and a formal investigation into an electric fire this week. the national transportation safety board is trying to find out why a battery pack caught fire in the auxiliary power unit in a 787 parked at logan international airport in boston on monday. the fire occurred in a japan airlines plane after the passengers and crew had left the plane.on tuesday, another of the airline's 787s, also in boston, was delayed for nearly four hours after a fuel leak. and on wednesday, all nippon canceled a domestic flight after a computer on board erroneously showed problems with the plane's brakes. these problems followed the forced diversion of a united airlines 787 in december after one of its six electric generators failed in midflight.mike sinnett, the 787's chief project engineer, said on wednesday that the program suffered from no more problems than any other new plane, like boeing's 777 when it was introduced in the mid-1990s.he defended the company's choice to use lithium-ion batteries, saying boeing was not looking for alternatives to them. and he said the 787 had a large number of redundant systems, meaning that if one or more failed, the plane could still fly and land safely. testing demonstrated the 787 could fly for more than five and a half hours with just one electrical generator functioning.""this is par for the course for any new airplane program,"" mr. sinnett said in a conference call with reporters. ""we have a responsibility and obligation to help assure people about the integrity and the robustness of the design.""asked whether the plane was safe, he responded: ""absolutely. i am 100 percent convinced the airplane is safe to fly. i fly on it myself all the time.""boeing declined to answer specific questions about monday's fire, citing the continuing investigation.the 787's operational reliability — a measure of how often it leaves the gate on time without a mechanical problem — is in the high 90 percent range, he said, a rate similar to the 777's at the same time in its production life.potential problems with the electrical systems and batteries could be significant, because the 787 carries a lot more advanced technology than previous generations of airplanes. it makes extensive use of lightweight carbon composites, has more fuel-efficient engines and relies mostly on electrical systems instead of mechanical ones to operate hydraulic pumps, de-ice the wings, pressurize the cabin and handle other tasks. it also has electric brakes instead of hydraulic ones.instead of drawing air from the engines to run these systems, the 787's novel architecture eliminates most pneumatic systems and replaces them with electric ones. this increases the fuel efficiency of the airplane by 2 to 3 percent at cruising altitude, according to boeing.randy tinseth, boeing's head of marketing, said in a statement on tuesday that the 787 had logged more than,000 flight cycles and flown more than,000 hours.boeing shares, which had dropped more than 5 percent in the last two days, recovered partly on wednesday, and were up.6 percent at.76.",88

(he has been the director there since.) ""it seems to me that the mystery of dance is incarnation, is spirit informing body. and one of the great notions that oliver propounds is that mind is not just going on up here."" mr. weschler, 61, pointed to his head. ""it's your entire body, your sense of your body. mind is happening at your fingertips.""the festival's far-flung events — 21 in all, to be presented at live arts — include two versions of the harold pinter play ""a kind of alaska"" (one performed in american sign language, excerpts from a michael nyman opera, a new film by bill morrison and a commissioned dance by donna uchizono, all inspired by dr. sacks's case studies as chronicled in his groundbreaking books, like the 1973 ""awakenings."" mr. jones said he hopes that dr. sacks's wide appeal will help live arts — the evolving product of a 2011 merger between dance theater workshop and his own bill t. jones/arnie zane dance company — to broaden its reach.siobhan burke spoke with mr. jones and dr. sacks, 79, about the festival. these are excerpts from their conversation.q. how did the two of you meet?oliver sacks the catalyst has been our friend ren, lawrence weschler.bill t. jones when we dance theater workshop and the bill t. jones/arnie zane dance company merged, we were thinking: what could we bring that would be new? we were going to emulate the 92nd street y, a kind of clearing house of ideas, a networking place where you could hear music one night, you could go hear someone read a book. and the humanities festival should be built around some topic that's of great interest to our community — i guess the dance world — and the greater community. and ren said, ""well, dr. oliver sacks, of course.""what is it like for you, dr. sacks, to see your books adapted into works for the stage?sacks i got a letter from harold pinter in, telling me that he'd read ""awakenings"" when it came out in '. he had wondered about dramatic possibilities but couldn't get it anywhere. then, he said, in the summer of 1980 he had a dream. he didn't know what the dream was, but when he awoke he had the first image, the first words of the play in his mind: ""something is happening."" and then he wrote the play in two days. i think it's a lovely example of incubation. in general i don't get too involved in the ballet or film or opera or whatever it is, but i'm delighted if i've played a part in sparking someone else's creativity.jones those of us working with your material, can we show you something about it that never occurred to you?sacks many things. i may see aspects of the humor of a situation, or the tragedy, which i hadn't been too conscious of.the festival opens with a discussion about weight lifting and long-distance swimming, which, dr, sacks, you've had some experience with.sacks fifty years ago i was very into competitive weight lifting. i got a record in california with a thing called the squat. i squatted with 600 pounds. later when i was on muscle beach, they called me dr. squat. at that time i was very, very powerful. now i'm an old man with arthritis.mr. jones, what do you see as the connections between your own process and dr. sacks's work?jones when i'm trying to explain to people what i think is grand and noble about movement, i say that the reason it is our most valuable connector as human beings is because that person onstage, who has a body similar to ours, is using that body in proxy for us. that kind of transference and connection is a very poetic way of saying something that i think the doctor's given his life to understanding: how an idea about movement can actually be felt. this fact is the way that i've been able to deal with issues of identity. and the making of art, the sharing of it, is in some ways — healing sounds way too sentimental — but it bridges the gap between individuals. when i read some of dr. sacks's meditations on how the brain works, in a way he demystifies these things that i have a feeling about. but in another way he encourages me to look with more courage at the physical world.sacks for better and worse i am a verbal person and live largely in a world of words. and i need to become more aware, occasionally do become more aware, of more elemental forms of communication with the body and with movement. one of the patients i wrote about in an earlier book was a woman who had a stroke and lost language. she became aphasic. but she became a genius at interpreting other people's movement and expressions and had her own powers of communicating through gesture and mimicry and mime. much more of the brain is devoted to movement than to language. language is only a little thing sitting on top of this huge ocean of movement. and i'm sure this was how people, human beings, first bonded, maybe chanting or dancing around the bonfire when there wasn't much in the way of language.dr. sacks, do you like to dance?sacks well, i've been seen dancing. in my younger days and in london i loved dancing, twirling round. it's unimaginable now. or perhaps not — perhaps imaginable. perhaps i should go back to it.",102
politics,"in travis county, juvenile justice officials have decided that they can do a better job than the state in dealing with the most troubled local offenders, considering texas' history of scandal and violence in youth lockups.""we will no longer commit kids to the state,"" said jeanne meurer, a travis county senior district judge . ""we will take care of all of our kids.""this year, legislators approved a law to allow the county to commit juvenile offenders to local detention facilities instead of sending them to large institutions operated by the texas juvenile justice department . if the travis county model is successful, it could set the stage for the next steps in reforming the juvenile justice system — sharply reducing the size of the agency and the population of detention centers .""travis county's experience doing this will tell us what's possible,"" said michele deitch, a professor at the university of texas at austin and an expert on jail conditions. (u.t.-austin is a corporate sponsor of the texas tribune .)the texas juvenile justice system has been in transition since, when it was rocked by reports that staff members had physically and sexually abused youths in its custody. lawmakers overhauled the agency and changed state law so that only felony offenders would be sent to state lockups. youths with lesser violations were kept closer to home, and counties were awarded more state money to care for them. the state has since closed nine of its secure facilities, leaving six open. one more is scheduled to close in the next two years. .the overhaul left only the most troubled youths in state lockups. but it also left staff members at the remaining facilities without clear direction. violence ensued. the rate of confirmed youth-on-youth assaults more than tripled at juvenile lockups statewide in the five years after lawmakers approved the overhaul.despite the troubles, ms. deitch said in a recent study that the agency is righting itself under a new executive director, michael griffiths. officials, she said, are beginning to carry out new behavior management strategies that are reducing violence and improving treatment for youths .""this system has a lot of really good, well-intentioned and reform-minded people working in it,"" ms. deitch said.the agency may look to the program in travis county as it moves the system forward, she said. since, the county has reduced the number of youths it sends to state facilities to fewer than 20 per year from more than. in december, the county will stop sending any to state lockups, keeping them instead in local detention facilities close to their families and to intensive counseling services for problems like addiction and abuse. judge meurer said that to determine if its experiment is a success, the county will review the recidivism rates of youths who go through the local program.""if we're successful, then hopefully others will join in the process,"" she said.even if many other counties follow the travis county model, judge meurer and ms. deitch said, texas will still need a system to handle youths from counties that do not have resources to treat and house the most violent offenders. if there is more cooperation between state and local officials, they said, both the size of the state agency and its cost to taxpayers could drop.mr. griffiths, the state juvenile justice director, who formerly ran the dallas county juvenile justice system, said that while he was pleased with improvements at state facilities, he was hopeful that the travis county model could set a path for the future.""i may be a naïve county guy,"" he said, ""but i think it's doable.""",164

science,"i lay on my back with my teeth clenched and my hands gripping the sides of a hospital bed. a crowd of strangers in white coats filled the tiny room. waves of pain lapped from my abdomen into my chest as the venom worked its way toward my heart.an experimental antivenin drug was about to be injected into my bloodstream, and while i waited for the needle to go in, i reflected that if anyone in the world was the right person to be bitten by a black widow spider, i was that guy.as a professional outdoorsman, i spend a lot of time around things that can bite, claw, stab or otherwise attack me. i have been lucky with snakes and reckless with bears . i have had some close calls with lionfish. it figures that the thing to finally nail me would be living on my own front porch.the black widow's graceful form and red hourglass marking have made it america's most recognizable spider. the eastern species, latrodectus mactans, is common from florida to new york and as far west as texas .but despite their fearsome reputation, black widows are surprisingly shy and retiring. over the course of your life, you have probably walked past hundreds of black widows without even realizing it. each one packs enough venom to lay out a heavyweight boxer for days, yet globally only a few people each year are killed by widow bites.widow webs are easy to identify, messy and close to the ground. i spotted the first one knitted against the steps of my front porch, in albemarle county, va. a little black ballerina was balanced in the back of it. i regretted killing her, but she was too close to an area where my children play. i blasted her with wasp spray, and she dropped out of her web .i hunted for more to photograph and eliminate. the perimeter of my house turned out to harbor a village of black widow webs. i racked up as many as a dozen little black-and-red trophies a day. fascinated by our proximity, i sought to learn more about these deadly neighbors.the black widow is unfairly named. female spiders rarely kill the male after mating, and possibly only in captivity. the male looks very different from the mature female; he is smaller and brownish. (the hourglass marking is quite variable in both sexes.) both sexes carry the same venom, but the females have more of it and their fangs can inject it deeper.one winter day, i carried inside a basket my children had left on the front lawn. i noticed a withered-looking black widow clinging to its side, still alive but stiff and slow with the cold. i dropped her into a mason jar, and for three months, she lived on my desk on a diet of moths.i learned a lot about black widows just by observing her. they are awkward outside their webs. they are poor climbers compared with other spiders, unable to scale the side of a jar. i was surprised that my pet widow never used her venom first. when confronted by prey that was too large or aggressive, she backed off rather than bite.one warm spring afternoon, i decided to go fishing for dinner. on the same front porch where i had removed so many black widows, i kept a pair of water shoes and some fishing tackle. i put the shoes and the tackle in my car and drove eight miles to my favored hole.i donned the shoes before walking to the edge of the water. within about a dozen steps, i felt a stinging sensation on the second toe of my left foot, as if there had been a thorn inside the shoe. then the pain increased to about that of a wasp's sting. i sat on a rock and removed the shoe. the squashed remains of a spider were smeared across the insole. i realized instantly what must have happened: a black widow from the porch had made its home in my shoe.for a long moment, i stared at my throbbing toe and wondered what to do.some people are more affected by the venom than others. most healthy adults experience a lot of pain and recover on their own. but others become incapacitated, and some die. which group would i fall into? or had i been bitten by something else entirely? why make a big deal out of nothing?i decided to wait and find out before getting behind the wheel. i dipped my foot into the cool water and decided i might as well pass the time by fishing.",32
business,"houston — over the past two years, environmentalists have chained themselves to the white house fence and otherwise coalesced around stopping the keystone xl pipeline as their top priority in the fight against global warming .but even if president obama rejects the pipeline, it might not matter much. oil companies are already building rail terminals to deliver oil from western canada to the united states, and even to asia .since july, plans have been announced for three large loading terminals in western canada with the combined capacity of,000 barrels a day — equivalent to roughly 40 percent of the capacity of the proposed keystone xl pipeline that is designed to bring oil from western alberta to refineries along the gulf coast .over all, canada is poised to quadruple its rail-loading capacity over the next few years to as much as,000 barrels a day, up from,000 today.the acceleration has come despite a derailment in the lakeside quebec town of lac-megantic in july, in which a runaway oil train bound for a refinery in eastern canada exploded, killing dozens of people and bankrupting the railway company . that accident and others more recently have renewed concerns about the safety of transporting oil by rail, and given an added argument to some who favor the keystone xl pipeline .""they don't give up,"" jesse prentice-dunn, a sierra club policy analyst, said of the oil industry .if all the new terminals are built, canada will potentially increase its exports to the united states by more than 20 percent — even if keystone xl is never built.shipping by rail can cost an additional $5 or more per barrel, but oil companies have decided that they cannot afford to wait.""the indecision on keystone xl really spawned innovation and mobilized alternatives, and rail is a clear part of the options available to our industry,"" said paul reimer, senior vice president in charge of transport and marketing at cenovus energy, a canadian oil company that is planning to increase rail shipments from,000 barrels a day to as many as,000 barrels a day by the end of. opponents want to stop the pipeline project to keep the oil sands in the ground. they say that emissions from development — through mining or steam heating out of the ground followed by upgrading for shipment — are more harmful than those that come from extracting most conventional crude oil . proponents say that canadian heavy oil is no more environmentally harmful than some crude oils already used in the united states, and that it would replace similar crudes from venezuela and mexico that are refined on the gulf coast .but now it seems that even if environmentalists win their battle over keystone, canada is destined to become an even more important energy provider, one way or another.the developing rail links for oil sands range across canada and over the border from the gulf coast to washington and california . railways can potentially give canadian producers a major outlet to oil -hungry china, including from refineries in washington and california .at least that is the hope of canadian oil companies, which now depend almost solely on the united states for exports.""we want to diversify our markets beyond just moving our product south,"" said peter symons, a spokesman for statoil, a norwegian oil giant that has signed contracts to lease two canadian oil loading terminals. ""we can get that product on a ship and get it to premium markets in asia .""several washington and oregon refiners and ports are planning or building rail projects for canadian heavy crude as well as light oil from north dakota . the texas refinery giant tesoro and the oil services company savage have announced a joint venture to build a $100 million, 42-acre oil -handling plant in the port of vancouver on the columbia river that could handle,000 barrels of oil each day if permits are granted.at the beginning of the year, only a trickle of canadian oil was transported by rail, no more than,000 barrels a day. there was limited rail off-loading capacity in american refineries outside the gulf coast, and only a small number of rail cars suitable to transport bitumen, the raw substance in oil sands that can be refined into petroleum products .",376
business,"at a time of heightened security concerns, disgruntled airline employees and frustrated passengers can be a combustible combination in a crowded aircraft, as travelers find themselves subject to lots of rules and little wiggle room to challenge them.on a united airlines flight from zurich to washington dulles international airport on jan. 2, bill pollock asked a flight attendant about a sign telling passengers not to venture beyond the curtain separating economy class from the rest of the plane. mr. pollock, a book publisher from burlingame, calif., said he wanted to stretch his legs and visit his wife seated on the opposite aisle, using the passageway behind the galleys in the plane's midsection.but when he questioned a flight attendant on the policy and began recording their conversation using his cellphone, the situation quickly escalated: the flight attendant grabbed his phone and nearby federal air marshals intervened.""two marshals held me up against the counter, they had my hands behind my back,"" mr. pollock said. ""i wasn't violent, i didn't use four-letter words. all i did was ask this guy about the sign on the curtain and they flipped out.""the flight was met by united personnel and security agents, who, mr. pollock said, took his statement and then sent him on his way. but the incident left him with lingering questions about his rights — like whether there is a policy restricting economy -class passengers to their own cabin (not just their own bathrooms, whether travelers are prohibited from videotaping flight crew and what recourse passengers have if airline or security personnel overreact.it turns out, none of these questions has a clear answer.les dorr, a spokesman for the federal aviation administration, said the agency did not have a rule limiting passenger movement on a plane, but federal regulations state, ""no person may assault, threaten, intimidate or interfere with a crew member in the performance of the crew member's duties aboard an aircraft.""rahsaan johnson, a united spokesman, said flight attendants routinely made an announcement asking customers not to pass through the curtains separating cabins, adding that federal regulations require passengers to ""comply with lighted signs, placards and crew member instructions.""mr. pollock conceded that he told the flight attendant he planned to ignore the sign, which other travelers had questioned in online travel forums .on a united flight from dulles airport to zurich last january, david snead said he saw a flight attendant pin a similar sign to the curtain in front of the economy cabin. to him, it appeared ""handmade.""""she got in arguments with people who tried to pass through,"" he said.

politics,"washington — sean jackson, like tens of thousands of other americans, has had trouble signing up for medical coverage using the healthcare. gov insurance marketplace, despite several attempts.""i was able to create an account on oct. 2, and i haven't been able to get into there since,"" said mr. jackson, a sports journalist living in ohio, a note of annoyance in his voice. ""i'll try at random times, like late at night or early in the morning. i sign in. it just goes to a blank screen.""the economists and policy wonks behind the affordable care act worry that the technical problems bedeviling the federal portal could become much more than an inconvenience. if applicants like mr. jackson decide to put off or give up on buying coverage, rising prices and even a destabilized insurance market could result.the enrollment of people like mr. jackson, who is, is vital for the health care law — and, for that matter, the entire health care system — to work. younger people, who tend to have very low anticipated medical costs, are supposed to help pay for the medical costs of older or sicker enrollees. without them, so-called risk pools in ohio and other states might become too risky, forcing insurers to raise premiums . those higher premiums could dissuade more of the young and healthy from signing up, forcing insurers to raise prices again.economists call the process ""adverse selection"" and warn that in its worst iteration it could lead to a ""death spiral"" of falling enrollment and climbing prices.economists and health analysts said the chances of such a spiral were slim in most states because americans who go without insurance would face penalties, starting next year. but they said that the endemic problems with the web site posed a serious question about the enrollment balance in many state plans.""if there are significantly more of the older and higher-cost people purchasing coverage than are expected, that's going to have a significant impact on premiums for the following year,"" said robert zirkelbach, a spokesman for america's health insurance plans, a lobbying group for insurers covering 200 million americans. he added, ""it could ultimately destabilize the market .""the young and healthy have always been seen as crucial to making the health law work, and the obama administration and many state governments have focused on getting them to sign up.for the white house, that has meant using the demographic microtargeting techniques used during the 2008 and 2012 presidential campaigns to identify and reach young people in the hope that they would make up about 40 percent of new enrollees in the health exchanges . for colorado, it has meant creating an advertisement showing ""bros"" drinking beer while celebrating insurance coverage . ""keg stands are crazy,"" the ad reads. ""not having health insurance is crazier.""but getting ""young invincibles,"" as insurers sometimes call them, to sign up for insurance is an uphill climb. even with the public campaigns, only about one in four 19- to 29-year-olds is even aware of the exchanges where they might buy affordable insurance, and the ignorance is especially acute among the uninsured, according to a survey this year by the commonwealth fund, a nonprofit research group .""there's very low awareness among young adults,"" said sara r. collins, an economist with the commonwealth fund . ""it's a concern in states that aren't actively promoting these exchanges . people might remain unaware,"" she said, referring to the 36 states that have opted to let the federal government run their exchanges for them. they include texas and mississippi, where public officials are campaigning against the health law .that lack of awareness makes it all the more important that those who do know about healthcare. gov — and try to purchase insurance there — are not dissuaded because of the glitches, the analysts said. older and sicker americans have a stronger incentive to keep trying to sign up despite the clunky site, they said.though economists, insurers and health analysts are concerned about the problems with healthcare. gov, which the obama administration has promised to fix by nov. 30, they said it was too early to tell whether the problems would cause an underenrollment of the young and healthy.   insurers would have a good sense of any problems by next spring, they said.no statistics are available on how many of them have signed up. states are providing no demographic details on enrollees. and the obama administration has declined to say how many people have purchased insurance in the 36 states where it runs the exchanges .jonathan gruber, an economist with the massachusetts institute of technology who helped create the affordable care act, said lessons could be drawn from massachusetts, which in 2006 implemented a similar law to provide near-universal coverage in the state .many massachusetts residents waited until just before the state law's tax penalty kicked in before signing up for insurance, he said. just 123 people signed up for subsidized insurance in the first month of enrollment, and only about,000 in the second month.ms. collins, of the commonwealth fund, also said the federal requirement to buy insurance might compel the young and healthy to sign up. ""as people learn about the provisions, and become aware of them, enrollment increases,"" she said. ""it may be that healthy people procrastinate longer than unhealthy people.""gary claxton, a policy expert with the kaiser family foundation, noted that provisions in the law help ease the costs to insurers if the enrollment mix raises medical costs more than expected, so they might not increase premiums too sharply.""if insurers are convinced the people that they've enrolled are going to continue to be sicker than expected, premiums will go up,"" he said. ""but if they believe people who didn't enroll in the first year will show up in the second, it might not have that big an impact on premiums .""for now, the obama administration is rushing to make signing up as smooth as possible to ensure that the young and healthy enroll. mr. jackson, of ohio, intends to see his application through.""at this point, i'm just printing it out and sending it in,"" he said, referring to one of the offline options for signing up. ""i'll probably have it done by the end of the month.""",218
science,"like ocean waters around the world, the chesapeake has become more and more acidic as a result of rising levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. now, by studying oyster populations in relation to acidity levels, a team of researchers has concluded that oysters — particularly their shells — can play a significant role in reducing that acidity.""oyster shells are made out of calcium carbonate, so they're sort of like an antacid pill,"" said george waldbusser, an assistant professor of earth, ocean and atmospheric sciences at oregon state and an author of the study, which appears in the journal ecology. ""in an undisturbed oyster reef, healthy oysters are generating a lot of biodeposits,"" a genteel term for excrement, ""which helps generate co to help break down those shells, which helps to regenerate the alkalinity back into the environment.""since the industrial revolution, ocean acidity has increased by about 30 percent, researchers say, and it is on track to double by. among the dangers of highly acidic waters are damage to fish larvae and corrosion of mollusk shells, which means the oysters in this case are helping themselves. ""it creates a positive feedback loop,"" dr. waldbusser said.programs to replenish chesapeake oyster reefs — mainly to filter out pollution and combat overharvesting — date to the 1960s. but the researchers say larger, older oysters should be introduced at a faster rate to fend off the rising acidity.",243
science,"instead, what the crew of the submersible pisces v found on the sea floor off hawaii in august was a huge japanese submarine that the united states sent to the bottom of the ocean in, lest it become a cold war trophy for the soviet union .the submarine, the i, was one of five that met a similar fate; some of the others have already been discovered. but terry kerby, the longtime operations director and chief submarine pilot for the hawaii undersea research laboratory, or hurl, called this one ""the real prize.""besides being the first of its class, it has particular historic value. ""this one actually trained for a mission: attack the panama canal,"" mr. kerby said.the megasub was remarkable for its size alone: 400 feet, nearly twice as long as a standard german u-boat of the time. more important, it could serve as an underwater aircraft carrier, carrying up to three folding-wing m6a1 seiran bombers.""at the time this thing was sunk, it and its sister ship were the most advanced submarines in the world,"" said james p. delgado, director of the national oceanic and atmospheric administration's maritime heritage program and one of two marine archaeologists aboard the pisces v when it came upon the i-400 wreck, 2,300 feet down. word of the aug. 1 discovery, which was announced monday in a university of hawaii news release, was withheld until the state department and japanese government could be informed.the five submarines captured by the navy, among the last remnants of the imperial japanese fleet, were taken back to pearl harbor for inspection. but under the treaty that ended the war in the pacific, any military technology acquired from japan was to be made available to other allied powers, including the soviet union .sensing that united states -soviet relations were already tense, however, the navy decided to scuttle the vessels off the coast of oahu rather than offer a rival access to such advanced technology .""more time could have been spent documenting them, but there was a cold war beginning,"" dr. delgado said. ""it was important to get those subs on the bottom and keep them out of the hands of the soviets.""the government's official line, that the five subs had been used for target practice and that the precise locations of the wrecks were unknown, has been corroborated by since-declassified navy documents, dr. delgado said.""the position that was given was miles away,"" he said. ""they were more interested in just sinking it and getting it out of the way.""federal funding cuts have driven hurl's submarine pilots to capitalize on every moment underwater, including commercial research excursions paid for by other organizations. for years while conducting these science dives — hurl's bread and butter, for the most part — mr. kerby has discreetly made note of points of interest on the ocean floor to revisit whenever the opportunity might arise.""in his back pocket, terry always has a list of things: a sonar contact, something of that sort that might turn out to be an interesting find,"" dr. delgado said. ""he wanted to find the i.""often the sea-floor irregularities that catch mr. kerby's interest turn out to be nothing more than rocks, carbon formations or debris. on the morning of aug. 1, however, one of his hunches was validated.""there was an anomaly up to the north that was very possibly a wreck,"" he said, but it was a long way from where they thought the i-400 was actually sunk. ""so when we came up and this giant bow came out of the dark, this submarine, it was a surprise to find it where we did. but it was a thrill.""the three men aboard the pisces v were guardedly optimistic about their find.""as we approached it from the sonar the excitement built, and suddenly there you were, at the mangled bow of a submarine,"" dr. delgado said. ""but it wasn't readily apparent that we were on i-400 until we really started to go through it piece by piece and match things up.""it wasn't an immediate high-five,"" he said.as for what awaits the i, its present resting place will probably be permanent. there are no plans to bring any of the wreckage to the surface.""in cases like this, when you find historic shipwrecks, what you've done is not just something archaeological,"" dr. delgado said.

politics,"washington — they sat side by side, trading laughs and finishing each other's thoughts. five years ago, the very prospect of such a moment would have been ""improbable,"" as one of them put it.but now as the improbable partnership between president obama and secretary of state hillary rodham clinton winds down with her pending departure from the cabinet, the two rivals -turned-allies sent a public signal of solidarity on sunday — at a time when one has run his last election and the other is contemplating one more.the unusual joint interview with mr. obama and mrs. clinton on the cbs news program ""60 minutes"" was noteworthy mainly because it happened. neither broke much ground in describing the journey that took them from bitter opponents for the democratic presidential nomination in 2008 to collaborators in dealing with terrorism, war, diplomacy and global economics.but the picture of comity was presumably what the white house wanted when it proposed the interview to cbs in the first place.the two laughed off the meaning of the interview for the 2016 election, when many democrats expect mrs. clinton to run again. mr. obama could hardly endorse her when his vice president, joseph r. biden jr ., appears to be angling for the party's nomination as well.""you guys in the press are incorrigible,"" mr. obama told steve kroft when he asked about the 2016 race during the interview, which was taped last week.

""but i have a lot of sympathy now when i pick up the paper and read about an athlete or one of our soldiers who's had traumatic brain injury .""mr. obama defended himself against criticism that he has been too passive on the world stage, pointing to his intervention in libya, where a revolution aided by nato warplanes led to the death of the country's longtime dictator. ""muammar qaddafi probably does not agree with that assessment,"" mr. obama said of the criticism, ""or at least if he was around, he wouldn't agree with that assessment.""the president lavished praise on mrs. clinton for her discipline, stamina and talent. and they put a glossy shine on history by brushing off the tough primary attacks five years ago as the product of trying to find differences where, they now say, there actually were not that many.""despite our hard-fought primary, we had such agreement on what needed to be done for our country,"" mrs. clinton said.""made for tough debates, by the way,"" mr. obama added, ""because we could never figure out what we were different on.""""yeah, we worked at that pretty hard,"" she said.as for any residual bad feelings, they said it had taken their aides longer to get over it than it had taken them.

arts,"you could call 2013 the year of the 30-something, as two of classical music's most prestigious bastions opened their doors to children of the 1980s. the polymathic nico muhly, born in, became the youngest composer to have a commissioned work performed at the metropolitan opera when his ""two boys"" had its american premiere in october. in april, caroline shaw (1982) was the youngest recipient of the pulitzer prize in music for her rapturous ""partita for eight voices.""both were works adroitly balanced between new and old. mr. muhly's opera united a musical language not far from britten with a savagely poignant plot out of the internet age . ""two boys"" remained, after years of development, a flawed piece: the central character, a female detective investigating a case of online intrigue and murder, still felt like a cipher even after the addition of a baggy back story.but while mr. muhly's style tends more toward the reflective than the propulsive, he embraced the depiction of our time with the same moving combination of plain beauty and adventurous sophistication as ms. shaw. her ""partita,"" written for the vocal octet roomful of teeth, of which she is a founding member, brought together elements that included chanting, humming, the deadpan instructions for a sol lewitt mural and a 19th-century hymn. it was an assured eclecticism utterly of our time that steered savvily clear of sentimentality.they were not the only relative youngsters to climb the field's heights this year. andris nelsons was 34 in may, when the boston symphony orchestra, one of the most storied american ensembles, announced that he would be its next music director, joining the under-40 likes of the los angeles philharmonic's gustavo dudamel and the philadelphia orchestra's yannick nézet-séguin.the ice-clear soprano angela meade, 36, and, especially, the powerhouse mezzo-soprano jamie barton, 32, brought joyful passion to bellini's ""norma"" when they took over the leads in the middle of the met's run in october. in ms. barton's focused, radiant performance, adalgisa's opening aria, ""deh! proteggimi, o dio!,"" finally felt like the prayer that it is.as pamina in los angeles opera's silent-film -inspired production of mozart's ""the magic flute"" last month, the elegant, creamy-toned soprano janai brugger, 30, embraced the production's constraints — all movements had to be synchronized with stage-filling animations — without compromising the tender force of her personality. it was a performance, like the two in ""norma,"" that was the apotheosis of the 30-something, with both the freshness of youth and the depth of age.",487
science,"los angeles — new research pinpoints the current location of nasa's voyager 1 spacecraft: it's still in our solar system.since last summer, the long-running spacecraft has been exploring uncharted territory where the effects of interstellar space, or the space between stars, can be felt. scientists don't know how thick this newfound region in the solar system is or how much farther voyager 1 has to travel to break to the other side.""it could actually be anytime or it could be several more years,"" said chief scientist ed stone of the nasa jet propulsion laboratory, which manages the mission.stone first described this unexpected zone at a meeting of the american geophysical union last year. a trio of papers published online thursday in the journal science confirmed just how strange this new layer is.soon after voyager 1 crossed into this region last august, low- energy charged particles that had been plentiful suddenly zipped outside while high-energy cosmic rays from interstellar space streamed inward. readings by one of voyager 1's instruments showed an abrupt increase in the magnetic field strength, but there was no change in the direction of the magnetic field lines — a sign that voyager 1 has not yet exited the solar system.voyager 1 and its twin, voyager, were launched in 1977 to visit the giant gas planets, beaming back dazzling postcards of jupiter, saturn and their moons. voyager 2 went on to tour uranus and neptune. after planet-hopping, they were sent on a trajectory toward interstellar space.voyager 1 is about 11 ½ billion miles from the sun. voyager 2 is about 9½ billion miles from the sun. the nuclear -powered spacecraft have enough fuel to operate their instruments until around.in the meantime, scientists are looking for any clues of a departure. given the time it takes to process the data, mission scientist leonard burlaga said there will be a lag between when voyager 1 finally sails into interstellar space and when the team can confirm the act. then there's always the possibility of surprises beyond the solar system.""crossing may not be an instantaneous thing,"" burlaga said.

business,"washington — the number of americans who signed contracts to buy existing homes in november was nearly unchanged from october, suggesting sales are stabilizing after several months of declines. the national association of realtors said on monday that its seasonally adjusted index for pending home sales ticked up to.7 from.5 in october. the october figure was revised lower from an initial reading of.1. higher mortgage rates and strong price gains over the last two years have slowed sales. the pending home sales index had fallen for five straight months before november. completed sales of existing homes fell for three straight months, the association said earlier this month .there is generally a one- to two-month lag from a signed contract to a completed sale.the average interest rate on a 30-year mortgage edged higher to.48 percent last week, from.47 percent the previous week . mortgage rates jumped about.25 percentage points from may through september, peaking at.6 percent, after the federal reserve's chairman, ben s. bernanke, indicated in the spring that the fed would start to scale back its economic stimulus program before the end of the year. earlier this month, the fed announced it would reduce its $85 billion in monthly purchases of treasury and mortgage-backed securities by $10 billion a month starting in january. the bond purchases are intended to hold down longer-term interest rates and encourage more borrowing and spending .robert kavcic, an economist at bmo capital markets, said that recent housing market indicators had been mixed. applications for mortgages to purchase homes fell to a nearly two-year low last week, he said.still, mr. kavcic said, ""we continue to believe that the u.s. housing market will absorb the upward move in mortgage rates and push higher in, helped by still-attractive affordability, better job growth and improved confidence in the recovery .""despite the recent declines, sales of existing homes should reach.1 million in, the highest total in seven years, the association forecast . that is 10 percent higher than 2012's total of almost.7 million . but it is still below the.5 million that is consistent with a healthy housing market .the association forecast that sales would remain largely flat in 2014 and then rise to.3 million in. steady job gains should make it easier for more people to buy homes. and mortgage rates remain low by historical standards . signed contracts for existing homes rose in the south and west last month, while falling in the northeast and midwest.",274
politics,"indianapolis — for glenda ritz, who took office as indiana's top education official this year, the awkward reality of being the lone statewide elected democrat here did not take long to blossom into all-out combat .now her conflict with gov . mike pence, a conservative former congressman, has become one of the most public and combative political fights to face his new administration .ms. ritz has accused the governor of creating a new education agency to undermine her office. mr. pence says that was not his aim. but the tension, months in the making, has boiled over at monthly state board of education meetings, where ms. ritz and board members, who are appointed by the governor, continue to wrestle for control over the state's education policies. in recent weeks, ms. ritz, the state superintendent of public instruction, has sued the board, walked out of a meeting to prevent a vote and accused mr. pence of orchestrating a subversive "" power grab "" against the department of education .""i feel he wants to have one agency for education, and that's going to be the agency,"" she said in a recent interview about the governor's new agency, the center for education and career innovation, known as c.e.c.i. she added, ""it is interfering with how i'm operating and how i'm going about making decisions.""the center, with fewer than 20 staff members, was created by mr. pence's executive order with the broad mission of better aligning the state's k, higher education and work force development strategies, according to claire fiddian-green, a co-director of the center and a special assistant to the governor . the center also provides staffing for the board of education, which previously relied on ms. ritz's 228 employees at the department of education for legal counsel and administrative support.critics have called the agency unneeded and its purpose unclear, a layer of bureaucracy added by a governor who typically favors small government . but board members said the move was necessary, accusing the superintendent of dragging her feet on issues that she campaigned against, like a new performance grading system for schools .""if you're opposed to something, you're not going to administer it with vigilance and enthusiasm,"" said daniel j. elsener, a board member who was reappointed by mr. pence in june and has complained about ms. ritz to the governor's staff.ms. ritz, a political newcomer and former school librarian, was elected in november 2012 with the help of teachers outraged with the incumbent superintendent, tony bennett, who pushed to expand voucher programs and test-based accountability for public schools . mr. bennett resigned as florida's commissioner of education in august amid reports of a school rating scandal from his time in indiana .mr. pence, a favorite among social and fiscal conservatives, was also elected in 2012 and has made improving the link between education and the job market part of his plan for the state . late last week, he announced a proposal to expand indiana's school voucher program, already among the broadest in the nation, which ms. ritz sued state officials over in 2011 and is now in charge of putting into effect.the first sign of a divorce between the department of education and the board came in may when mr. pence signed a larger spending bill that separated the two bodies. when he created c.e.c.i. in august, ms. ritz said, she learned about the initiative on the day of the announcement, despite having met with the governor just days before.""the governor is trying to act like he's out of the fray,"" said brian howey, the editor of howey politics indiana, a newsletter. ""but at the same time his appointees are doing all this maneuvering."" mr. howey also said democrats may use the feud to fuel supporters in some 2014 legislative elections .defending himself last month in an op-ed article that ran in newspapers across the state, mr. pence denied that the move had been political and said his new center ""breaks down the silos"" between the state's education and work force responsibilities and ""does so without taking any authority away from the department of education .""mr. pence also expressed ""regret that the department of education and the superintendent have misunderstood my sincere desire to work with them on behalf of all the children of indiana .""still, an internal c.e.c.i. policy document made public by ms. ritz's office last week showed the agency recommended a change to state law that would remove ms. ritz from her position as chairwoman of the board, replacing her with a governor appointee. kara brooks, a spokeswoman for mr. pence, said the document was presented in october to the governor, who ""immediately squashed"" the idea.ms. ritz and mr. pence met in private last month, agreeing to let the national association of state boards of election mediate at a session to clarify the ""roles, responsibilities and the operations of the board,"" according to a joint statement. that session was held on wednesday.in indiana, governors appoint all 10 members of the board of education, which has final say on k-12 policy. but the state is one of 12 that do not have an appointed superintendent, according to the national association. in indiana and oklahoma, the elected superintendents also lead the boards of education — a shared authority that can get complicated when political parties collide. education meetings, once dull, now feature dueling legal opinions — the board has its own counsel — and arguments over voting procedures.in october, ms. ritz filed a lawsuit claiming that board members violated the state's open-meetings law when they sent a letter asking a legislative agency to step in and help calculate school performance grades. the department of education, denying claims of obstruction, has said significant problems with the company administering standardized tests this year delayed release of the numbers, which members of the board complained was taking too long.a judge dismissed that lawsuit; a similar complaint brought by four citizens was ruled unfounded by indiana's public access councilor this month.last month, the confrontation grew when board members sought to vote on a resolution that would have given their staff at c.e.c.i. a larger role in evaluating academic standards that will be adopted next year. ms. ritz, who said it was her department's job to evaluate the standards, declared the resolution ""improper,"" saying it violated state statute, and ended the meeting abruptly.the state attorney general has since said the resolution passes legal muster; board members said they intended to consider it again at the next scheduled meeting on dec. 20, if not sooner.",284
sports,"charlotte, n.c. — the seattle seahawks keep coming up with new weapons on offense — and keep winning games .the seahawks, coming off an 11-5 season last year, got a huge play from second-year wide receiver jermaine kearse on sunday to beat the carolina panthers 12-7 in the season opener .kearse hauled in a 43-yard touchdown pass from russell wilson with:13 left for the go-ahead score. it was the first career touchdown catch for kearse, who came into the game with three career receptions.""i can't you how proud i am of him,"" seahawks receiver doug baldwin said. ""it gives me goose bumps just talking about him because he's like a brother to me. it was a very proud moment when i saw him catch that ball.""but nobody should be surprised. he was doing it in the preseason. he's come a long way and his mentality has changed to where he knows he can dominate this game.""five reasons the seahawks beat the panthers :1. seattle's opportunistic defense: down, the panthers were driving for the go-ahead score when deangelo williams raced around right end.but 16 yards down the field, safety earl thomas closed on williams as he attempted to make a spin move toward the end zone and knocked the ball free from behind. williams never saw him.hustling defensive tackle tony mcdaniel made the recovery at the seattle 8 and carolina's drive was thwarted.the panthers would not get the ball again.""that shows what our football team is all about, that relentless nature to keep going after the ball,"" wilson said. ""we're getting close to the game being on the line, and that's what makes earl thomas the best in the game.""2. wilson cool under pressure: even after the seahawks recovered that fumble there was still the matter of running the final:25 off the clock.and wilson did just that, running what nfl coaches call the ""four-minute offense"" to perfection.after marshawn lynch was tackled for a 5-yard loss on first down, he calmly completed a 12- yard pass to derrick coleman and a 13- yard pass to doug baldwin on third-and-3 to move the chains and silence the crowd.wilson was 4 of 4 for 54 yards on the drive before taking a knee three times to run out the clock.wilson called the completion to baldwin ""the biggest play of the game.""""we are trying to finish the game and the biggest thing is can we make the plays to keep the drive alive and cut off the clock?"" wilson said.3. cam newton held in check: panthers quarterback cam newton was limited to 125 yards passing by the seahawks and that simply isn't going to get the job done.there were concerns about carolina's offense under new coordinator mike shula and those will only be heightened after the panthers managed just one touchdown.newton missed a couple of passes — he overthrew brandon lafell and underthrew steve smith — but he didn't get much help from his normally reliable tight end greg olsen, who dropped two catchable passes.4. self-inflicted mistakes by panthers : second-year defensive end frank alexander ruined a great sack by teammate charles godfrey on a potential momentum-turning play when he decided to punch a seattle lineman after the completion of the play.it resulted in an ejection and an automatic first down for the seahawks .it was one of a few mental blunders for the panthers .armond smith, who works as gunner on carolina's special teams, also ran out of bounds twice costing the panthers 30 yards in penalty yardage. the second one was particularly costly. the panthers had the seahawks pinned at the 5- yard line but the penalty forced them to re-kick. seattle returned the next punt to the 26 giving them some breathing room.six plays later, wilson hit kearse with the go-ahead touchdown pass .""i'm going to look at the tape as far as armond is concerned,"" panthers coach ron rivera said. ""again, the explanation they gave me, i have to see it on tape to see if it jives. as far as frank is concerned, we talked about them being chippier. we talked about things that they do to try and get you out of your game and he fell for it. to me it was the case of the second man getting caught. again, we have to get those things corrected because you can't let that happen.""5. no help for steve smith : steve smith had a solid game with six catches for 51 yards, but carolina's other wide receivers were held to a combined one catch — that a 10- yard reception by ted ginn jr.lafell, carolina's no. 2 receiver, was blanketed all day and was only targeted one time — and that play was called back on a penalty.domenik hixon, brought in to be the no. 3 receiver, was inactive because of a hamstring injury.ginn worked as the no. 3 receiver and at times was manhandled by seattle's more physical cornerbacks at the line of scrimmage .",67

business,"through a partnership with solarcity, a residential and commercial installer, honda and acura will offer their customers home solar systems at little or no upfront cost, the companies said on tuesday. the automaker will also offer its dealers preferential terms to lease or buy systems from solarcity on a case -by- case basis, executives said.the deal, in which honda will provide financing for $65 million worth of installations, will help the automaker promote its environmental aims and earn a modest return, executives said. it could also open the door for more corporate investment in solar leasing companies, which has largely been limited to a small cluster of banks to provide capital for their projects.and solarcity, one of the few clean- tech start-ups to find a market for an initial public offering of its stock last year, will potentially gain access to tens of millions of new customers through honda's vast lists of current and previous owners .""when we partner with financial institutions, they aren't promoting us to their customers, they're essentially just providing us with capital,"" said lyndon r. rive, solarcity's chief executive . but with honda, he said, the company is gaining, ""access to a broader customer base, and a customer base that is conscious of the environment.""whether the marriage will prove successful remains to be seen. ""i don't think that by finding honda buyers you've homed in on the perfect solar customer, but there's enough overlapping between the demographics that you're better off than the general population,"" said shayle kann, vice president at gtm research, adding that car buyers were more likely to own their homes and have the income and credit history to qualify for solar leasing. while the american solar industry in general has been struggling in the face of declining government subsidies, overcapacity in production and a glut of inexpensive chinese panels, interest and investment in solar leasing, or third- party ownership, has continued to grow . according to a recent report from gtm research, a renewable energy consulting firm that is a unit of greentech media, third- party ownership accounts for more than 70 percent of all residential installations in developed markets like arizona, california and colorado and has generated at least.4 billion in private investment since.solarcity and a rival, sunrun, were among pioneers of the approach, but players like clean power finance and vivint, a home security company owned by the blackstone group, are also gaining momentum.in a typical arrangement, a company provides a system at little or no cost in exchange for a long-term contract in which the customer pays a fixed fee for the electricity generated, set at less than the customer would pay for power from the local utility. the solar price often rises over the life of the agreement, which can last 20 years.honda approached solarcity more than a year ago when it was looking for a partner to provide solar installation services for its hybrid and electric vehicle customers, said ryan harty, american honda's assistant manager for environmental business development . the company then decided to expand to all its customers — a group it is defining ""very, very broadly,"" mr. harty said, to include not just car owners but also those who have explored its web sites . the offer will be available in 14 states : arizona, california, colorado, connecticut, delaware, hawaii, maryland, massachusetts, new york, new jersey, oregon, pennsylvania, texas and washington, and the district of columbia .the two companies say they hope the joint venture leads to projects that integrate solar power and electric vehicle recharging for its customers .the program will give honda and acura customers an extra $400 discount on top of solarcity's normal promotions, which they can use to sweeten the terms of the solar contract, like eliminating the escalation of the monthly payment . honda projects the fund can finance as many as,000 systems on homes and 20 for its dealers . if the program catches on, honda plans to expand it. executives said they saw more immediate promise in cutting carbon emissions through solar power than the electric vehicles it would sell.",174
sports,"tokyo — pitcher masahiro tanaka is set to move to the majors next season after his japanese team rakuten eagles announced wednesday it was prepared to let him leave, reversing its earlier rejection.rakuten eagles president yozo tachibana told a news conference that the team has decided to release him through the posting system, paving the way for his departure. tachibana said tanaka's outstanding performance over the past seven years, including this season, meant he deserved to be allowed to move to the u.s.tanaka, a 25-year-old right-hander, went 24-0 with a.27 era with the eagles during the regular season and sought a move to the majors . but he has two years remaining on his contract and rakuten was under no obligation to release him.""i'm grateful to the team for allowing me to try. now i've made a first step,"" he said. ""i hope i would receive offers from as many teams as possible so i have a wider option.""the new york yankees are considered the leading candidates to sign tanaka, though the capping of the posting fee at $20 million meant many other teams could also afford to make offers.the eagles had rejected the new posting system but it was passed by a vote of japan's professional teams . following that decision, rakuten had initially said they want to retain tanaka, before wednesday's change of heart .tachibana said the team took into consideration tanaka's ""outstanding contribution to the team"" since he joined the eagles seven years ago . tanaka's perfect 24-0 record set a new mark in the history of japanese professional baseball and brought a first league championship to the team based in sendai, which is still recovering from the devastation wrought by the 2011 earthquake and tsunami .for 30 days from the time a player is posted, any mlb team can attempt to sign the player. it pays the posting fee only if it signs the player. under the new rules, a japanese club may make players available between nov. 1 and feb. 1. a player who is not signed may not be posted again until the following nov. 1.tachibana, the rakuten president, said his team is happy to retain tanaka if he does not reach an agreement with an mlb team.the new posting system was negotiated after some mlb teams objected that only the richest clubs could afford to bid on top japanese players.under the previous agreement, which began in 1998 and ran through last offseason, there was no cap on bidding and only the highest bidder could negotiate with the player. boston obtained pitcher daisuke matsuzaka from the seibu lions before the 2007 season for,111,111.11, and agreed to a $52 million, six-year contract. texas got pitcher yu darvish from the hokkaido nippon ham fighters before the 2012 season for,703,411 and gave him a $56 million, six-year deal.",237
arts,"americans call them ""the nosebleeds."" we british know them as ""the gods."" they're the top tiers of the world's major opera houses, and during my first years of dancegoing in the 1970s and '80s in london, those cheap seats were where i spent most of my time. (friends used to suggest that i should just string up a hammock at covent garden and spend the night there, too.) when i first visited new york, standing room at the back of the fourth ring of the new york state theater was where i occupied every evening.critics, however, are given seats in the lower parts of the house; and i've sat there consistently in my years as chief dance critic of the new york times . yet part of me has been homesick for that higher and more sharply three-dimensional view. this fall, i acted on that wish. during the recent seasons at the david h. koch theater by new york city ballet and american ballet theater, i watched 10 performances from the third and, mainly, the fourth rings.and yes, it was good to be back. as every theatergoer knows, from the top balcony, you see faces less well, patterns better. the successive tableaus of michel fokine's ""les sylphides,"" the orthodox but fast-changing geometries of george balanchine's ""theme and variations"" and the radically opposed geometries of his ""symphony in three movements,"" the energetically charged vertical lines of mark morris's ""gong"" and the pretty shapes of christopher wheeldon's ""soirée musicale: these, of course, are legible from the farthest row.but there's much more about dance to be seen. paradoxical though this sounds, i'd say that from the top of the house, you see dancers less well, their dancing better.today, though loving that perspective, i confess that my middle-aged eyes are such that i can't do a critic's job efficiently from the top of the house. is that city ballet's janie taylor or teresa reichlen? only when they start dancing does their dissimilarity become striking. in stanton welch's ""clear,"" at ballet theater, however, eight male dancers became just marcelo gomes and seven unidentifiable others.yet where eyes permit, i'd encourage all dancegoers to watch a few performances from the gods. (a bonus is the price; tickets for my fourth-ring seats ranged from $20 to $89 each versus the most expensive orchestra seats at $150 to.)more strongly yet, i would urge dancers, choreographers and artistic directors to do so. (ninette de valois, founding director of the royal ballet, always said the best seats for ballet at covent garden were those in the center of the front row of the gallery, officially named the amphitheater and lovingly known by many as the amphi.) what dancing, which choreography, which dancers, make an impression so far away? there's much to learn.time was when i could identify most dancers even from the farthest rows. yet now that some faces are blurry from there, other aspects of dancing grow only clearer. it's astonishing how distinct — to my eyes, certainly — necks, feet, waists, thighs prove. phrasing and dynamics grow in significance. and footwork beams out, like reflective glass catching sunlight from an opposite hillside.watching city ballet's "" swan lake "" up in row n of the fourth ring showed me anew why i love ballet (though not that peter martins production. tiny details of footwork opening and closing gleamed like jewels. the swelling arch of a dancer's foot, whether stretched in the air or on point, proved as individual from afar as the way a great singer enters and sustains a high note. from afar, not only do you see what registers, you also see how extraordinarily lucid a few dancers become.it's not just an ensemble that creates patterns; a single dancer does, too. the mere view of mr. gomes's arm, curving from a straight line to a rounded position in mr. welch's ""clear,"" was a potent demonstration of geometric sculpture; from above, i felt its volumetric impact more keenly. when two relatively faceless junior ballet theater women, side by side in twyla tharp's ""bach partita,"" each extended a leg sideways to the same height, the difference between those raised legs was drastic: one just an empty shape, the other beaming forth power into the air.",213
politics,"washington — senate republicans on thursday blocked president obama's nominee to lead the pentagon in a defiant move likely to further strain partisan tensions while preventing the white house, at least temporarily, from assembling its second-term national security team.in a result that broke down almost strictly along party lines, democratic senators could not muster the support to advance the nomination of chuck hagel, a former republican senator from nebraska, to a final vote. the vote was 58 to, falling short of the 60 that were needed. democrats vowed to try again to resuscitate the nomination of mr. hagel, a decorated vietnam veteran, when the senate returns from recess in 10 days. several republicans who voted against mr. hagel said they would not block a final vote. democrats accused the opponents of mounting the first-ever filibuster against a pentagon chief for their own political purposes.""just when you thought things couldn't get worse, it gets worse,"" said senator harry reid of nevada, the majority leader . ""i guess to be able to run for the senate as a republican in most places of the country, you need to have a résumé that says, 'i helped filibuster one of the president's nominees.' ""the vote represented the first time in history that the senate has required that a nominee for secretary of defense clear the 60-vote hurdle before a final, simple majority vote. republicans, who took the extraordinary step of rebuffing their former colleague and fellow party member, insisted that democrats were trying to rush a vote on a crucial cabinet position that deserved more consideration.""we didn't need to have this vote today,"" said senator john cornyn of texas, the second-ranking senate republican . ""but the white house and the majority leader were determined to have this vote in order to try to get a story in the newspaper, one that misrepresents the nature of the objection on this side.""all day, a tense standoff played out in the capitol as one party tried to force the other into a more politically undesirable position. republicans, calculating that democrats might want to avoid forcing a vote that could result in an embarrassing setback for the president, had hoped to press mr. reid to back down and reschedule after the senate returns from its recess. democrats, mindful that republicans did not want to be blamed for jeopardizing the pentagon's stability for political purposes, decided to press ahead and require republicans to record a vote against mr. hagel, allowing democrats to accuse them of a new level of obstructionism .while the showdown vote was set for friday morning, just after 3 p.m. on thursday mr. reid came to the senate floor to move that it be called instead at:15. that forced senators like john mccain of arizona and lindsey graham of south carolina, members of the senate armed services committee who have said that they find the act of filibustering a defense secretary distasteful, to cast votes that had the same result as a filibuster, even if they refused to call it that.four republicans joined democrats in voting that debate on the nomination should end: senators thad cochran of mississippi, susan collins of maine, mike johanns of nebraska and lisa murkowski of alaska. senator orrin g . hatch of utah voted present because he said he was wary of the precedent a no vote would set, even though anything other than a yes vote had the same practical effect on the outcome.because of parliamentary rules, mr. reid voted with republicans to allow him to bring the hagel nomination back for another vote. counting mr. reid, mr. hagel was actually just one vote shy of the 60 needed.given the outcome, a major matter of concern for the white house over the next 10 days is that mr. hagel's opponents — an array of groups that includes conservative and pro-israel forces — could intensify their campaigns to defeat his nomination. leaders of these groups said in interviews that they expected their efforts to include more phone calls urging conservative voters to tell their senators to vote no; new efforts to unearth embarrassing details from mr. hagel's past; and, potentially, a new round of television advertisements pressuring democrats to drop their support for him.",50
politics,"washington — despite the addition of more than two million jobs last year, soaring corporate profits and continuing economic growth, income for the typical american household did not rise in 2012 and poverty failed to fall, new data from the census bureau show.""the poverty and income numbers are a metaphor for the entire economy,"" said ron haskins of the brookings institution . ""everything's on hold, but at a bad level.""over a longer perspective, the figures reveal that the income of the median american household today, adjusted for inflation, is no higher than it was for the equivalent household in the late 1980s.for all but the most highly educated and affluent americans, incomes have stagnated, or worse, for more than a decade. the census report found that median household income, adjusted for inflation, was,017 in, down about 9 percent from an inflation-adjusted peak of,080 in, mostly as a result of the longest and most damaging recession since the depression. most people have had no gains since the economy hit bottom in.the government's authoritative annual report on incomes, poverty and health insurance, released tuesday, underscores that the economic recovery has largely failed to reach the poor and the middle class, even as the unemployment rate continues to sink and growth has returned. government programs remain a lifeline for millions. unemployment insurance, whose eligibility the federal government expanded in response to the downturn, kept.7 million people out of poverty last year. food stamps, if counted as income, would have kept out four million .since the recession ended in, income gains have accrued almost entirely to the top earners, the census bureau found. the top 5 percent of earners — households making more than about,000 a year — have recovered their losses and earned about as much in 2012 as they did before the recession . but those in the bottom 80 percent of the income distribution are generally making considerably less than they had been, hit by high rates of unemployment and nonexistent wage growth .moreover, economists believe that the report understates the degree of income inequality in the united states, by not including, among other things, earnings from capital gains made on rising stock prices .in one glimmer of improvement, the number of men working full time year-round with earnings increased by one million from 2011 to, to a total of 59 million . still, the labor market continues to look weak, in particular for less-educated and lower-income men. the labor force participation rate of men has fallen steadily for the past 60 years . in no small part, that is because the median earnings of men working full time have not increased in real terms since the early 1970s.for women, the earnings stall started about a decade ago, when the gender pay gap stopped closing. ""the wage gap hasn't budged a penny,"" said fatima goss graves of the national women's law center . ""after 11 years of no progress on equal pay, policy makers need to get moving to improve the country's pay discrimination laws, raise the minimum wage and remove the barriers women face in higher-wage jobs .""the west was the only region that experienced a statistically significant increase in median income, the census bureau said, while all other regions were flat. that most likely reflects the relatively strong growth in washington, oregon, california and utah last year. north dakota, experiencing an oil and gas boom, is the fastest-growing state, though its population is so small that it barely affects the national statistics.no racial or ethnic group experienced significant changes in income, but that left the gap between asians, at the top, and blacks, at the bottom, as wide as before. the median income for asian households was,600. for non-hispanic whites, it was about,000, while the typical hispanic household had an income of,000, and blacks were at,300.",368

""it shows our ideas are not stale. we are not dead.""in the months since last fall's elections, which emphasized the growing importance of the hispanic vote across the nation, state republican leaders have redoubled efforts to reach out to them, mr. huff said. this month, he said, he visited a large evangelical hispanic church in san diego along with connie conway, the assembly minority leader, and jim brulte, the republican party chairman .""we have to show up to people and help them realize that we don't have three eyes and five hands or whatever that scares them,"" he said. ""it's a long time to rebuild this party and this brand, but i think we're on that road. andy vidak is the first step in that long path for us.""a third-generation resident of the central valley, mr. vidak grows cherries and raises cattle. he emphasizes his business background, describing himself as a nonpolitician. he gained name recognition by mounting a strong, though ultimately unsuccessful, challenge in 2010 to jim costa, the democratic congressman here.he talks about creating jobs, and his opposition to big government projects like the planned high-speed rail system between san francisco and los angeles . he favors immigration change that would open a path to citizenship for those who came here illegally.on a recent morning, mr. vidak met with black ministers in bakersfield. a few hours later, wearing a cowboy hat, he checked in with volunteers at his campaign headquarters here, his hometown. a small city west of highway, with a drive-in movie theater and an old-fashioned ice cream parlor downtown that was packed late in the afternoon, hanford reminded mr. vidak of his upbringing in visalia, a larger city about 20 miles east, he said.the 16th senate district, which was gerrymandered as a safe democratic seat in, became vacant this year when the former occupant, michael rubio, resigned abruptly for a government relations job with chevron. mr. vidak said he decided to run despite what most people considered unfavorable demographics.""i don't see it that way because i live here,"" he said. ""everybody's the same to me. this district is a very, very conservative district. go to church. they like their guns. family is no. 1. they all work hard. i'm no different than anyone else here.""asked how republicans can win over hispanic voters, he said simply, ""be yourself.""on a recent afternoon, his opponent, ms. perez, accompanied by her husband, fernando jara, 37, knocked on doors of registered democrats in the poor, heavily hispanic part of bakersfield where both grew up. ms. perez describes herself as a moderate democrat who strongly supports the high-speed rail project but also california's oil industry, which is based in bakersfield.",134
