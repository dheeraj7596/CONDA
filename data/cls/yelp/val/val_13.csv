5,"still my favorite pizza place in las vegas, and actually anywhere! \n\ni always order the diavola with poached egg, garlic, and uncut. when i get the pizza with the soft yolk, i break it and spread it all over the pizza like a sauce. somehow yolks add a creamy flavor to things that cannot be imitated with anything else i know of....yummy. don't forget to ask for the spicy olive oil to drench over your pizza. the housemade chili oil adds a great kick. \n\nif you have leftovers and decide to take it home, warm it up in an oven or eat it cold. microwaving would destroy the nice crusty crust. \n\nservice either inside, at the bar or outside is always friendly. it really seems like the staff likes working here and with each other. this reminds me of my restaurant days.",1637
3,"my husband and i haven't been back to zoes since the opening until today. today was a sunny day and it sounded right to sit outside and eat at zoes. we ordered a chicken salad sandwich with fresh fruit and a chicken kabob plate. oh, and a limeade...which was very sweet and delicious.\n\nthis time around the food seemed average. the chicken salad didn't have pizazz and the chicken kabobs were dry. they should include a drop of hummus or yogurt dip on the kabob plate; however, the vinegar sauce on the table added a bit.\n\nsome of the staff were friendly and some not like what i remembered the first time around. fast service and ideal for those of you in a hurry.",49
1,the ham and biscuit sandwich is horrible and need to be take off the market. the people's money need to be refunded its too salty. we were so disappointed when we had to get this on our layover and had to get directly on the plane.,1121
2,"most disappoint museum experience ever.  i was really looking forward to going here and the disappointment started from buying my admissions ticket. first: zero customer service a very rude and curt girl, who sold me my admissions ticket, was my first contact with the museum.\n\nsecond, they had three, yes three exhibits.  really i'm paying $19 dollars to see some half baked exhibits that don't really educate or immerse the visitor?  i've never been to a museum where they had only three exhibits.  okay maybe one museum had less than that, but it was free and i donated $2 just to help keep them around.  \n\nthird, even though i'm a child at heart and love an interactive museum as much as the next person this museum was way too geared for children.  besides that the information presented was short and not in depth.\n\nas a sort of topper to the whole experience when i was interacting with one of the exhibits a very rude employee decided to make me feel completely un-welcomed in the museum.  he said to me, \""you know that is for 4 year olds?\""  i immediately looked around looking for the sign that says you may not interact with this exhibit if you are over the age of 4.  the whole point of a museum is to educate and inform the visitors regardless of their age.  i could see maybe admonishing an adult who was hogging an exhibit stopping children from using it, but i was more than accommodating towards all the other guests there.\n\nin short i wouldn't waste my money here.   likely, unless you are a child under the age of 9, you probably wont get much out of it and even at that age you probably wont get much out of it.  whoever is the curator or head of this museum really needs to have another look at whether they are actually providing a service to their patrons.\n\nafter this long complaint you may be wondering why i gave them two stars instead of just one.  the one saving grace was that the museum had at least some educational properties to it, although not that many.  it really was a glorified expensive playground, but at least there was some education incorporated into the exhibits.  so they didn't fail completely.",376
2,"came by for dinner with our 24-hour buffet of buffets wristbands.\n\nthere was no line entering the buffet and once you reach the front of the line, photographers take photos of your group while you hold a giant fork and spoon. the photographers come by your table later to try and sell you the photos prints for $20.\n\nthe food was left much to be desired. the crab legs were small, and unlike le village buffet, they weren't sliced in half, making it a challenge to eat. the highlight of the meal was probably the meatballs or sausages, which weren't even that great.\n\nand what's up with the lack of restrooms in the buffet? i had to walk out to the casino during my meal to use the loo...",290
3,"this used to be a real dirty and messy beach according to the locals, now the local council have specialist equipment to sift the beach of 70% of the rubbish left behind by the beach goers it is sad in a way as when you leave you see that the bins are half empty and the beach is full of rubbish at the end of the day. i saw a lot of nails and deadly spikes left behind by barbeques and people playing volley ball. this place gets real busy at the weekend, and warm days with cafe's nearby selling ice cream and cold drinks. sadly there is nothing grand here as the tacky amusement arcade's have moved in.",301
5,"i want to start my review with a disclaimer: i work beverage at sin city theater where murray is now. i have only rarely worked during his show i normally work the later shows & when you work a show you don't pay much attention to the portions of it when you are normally busy\nthat being said i had worked two or three times during the show at the bar & i did think it was cute from an adult point of view but when i took my son & two other children (plus two more, with 5 total kids in our party) for his 10th birthday i did not realize how much fun we would have. my son said it was his best birthday ever.\npart of it was seeing the show through the eyes of excited happy kids but i liked the things they enjoyed as well. it is up close right there a-volunteer-from-the-audience magic. i know a little bit about magic shows (very little but some) and i thought the tricks were very well performed, the kids came in slightly skeptical but after the first few minutes were like amazed and astounded. kids are hard to excite nowadays & this did it. \nhis routine is also funny and keeps you on your toes, one of the adults with me was a fellow employee & we both giggled along with his jokes. he interacts well with his audience using a good mix of front row/back row volunteers & he did pick some kids (and seniors) which honestly must be horrifying for a performer because kids are capable of anything. \nlefty was great too, as was chloe. the \""sidekick\"" & \""assistant\"" never get enough credit but they really made the show. lefty is cute & funny & chloe is gorgeous & engaging. \nthe kids all want to do magic now which i think is great because we have enough video game players in the world it would be nice to have more magicians. \ni love shows like this because this is what vegas was built on & its good for our community. \nthis show is great for kids because of the size & material it's inspiring to them. you can take your child to a movie on  a screen where they know it's make believe or you can take them to something that inspires them to get out there & learn something. my kids were elementary age but i think older kids too. there were some high school age kids there who were having a great time, one got chosen to go on stage and loved it.\nit is great for adults who want to go to an early show (4pm) and have a slightly ironic laugh and a good time, also great for seniors.",1081
4,"vibe is great in here, a mix of an american sports bar with delicious mexican food. clean restaurant with a friendly staff. i ordered fish tacos and black beans, both were very different than i've ever had but i'm not complaining. definitely going to become a regular to this place.",327
4,"i cruised to the burrito co. to try the breakfast burrito. i will have to say, the breakfast burrito is superior than the meat/bean burrito.\n\nthe breakfast burritos are a nice size, fresh and tasty. i would like to see more meat. i ordered my burrito with sausage and probably received the about 2 links of sausage.\n\nthe price is right, about $3.50 for the burrito.",532
2,"i've been dying to make it by this shop since they opened.  i stopped by today and left feeling unimpressed.  i purchased the tropical storm which is supposed to be a lime cake.  although the cake is beautifully moist and soft, it has zero flavor.  the cream cheese icing is great, but that's simple enough to do at home.  the cupcakes were gorgeous, but looks aren't the reason i purchased.  the previous review is correct about the insane amount of icing.  luckily i don't feel guilty for throwing out the majority of my cupcake.\n\ni did buy other flavors for the rest of my family.  if they have any stellar response, i'll update, but otherwise, i'll likely not return.\n\n**updated - these were a bust in my house.  my 4 year old daughter didn't even finish half of the icing, much less hardly any of the cake (birthday surprise cupcake).  i taste the other cupcakes (chocolate and red velvet) and while they were better than mine, still not good enough for a repeat visit.",397

3,"if you're looking for an affordable hotel in a good location while in vegas, monte carlo is your place. i know i'll never be able to afford something like the wynn or any of the other fancy hotels, and i'm fine with that. no one goes to vegas to be in a hotel room, right? \n\nafter staying at nyny the year before, we decided to stay at the monte carlo this year to save some buckage. as long as a hotel room is clean, i can deal. however, some of the aspects of the monte carlo's room cleanliness were a bit questionable... we had a few not-sure-if-they're-clean-but-they're-super-crunchy towels and there was an interesting stain on the curtains... blood or nail polish? we decided to believe it was nail polish. here's hoping. but, whatever. if you drink enough, you won't even notice these things.\n\naside from the room... we had excellent service from everyone working at the hotel. we befriended one of the player's club guys, which netted each girl a free $20 to gamble with every day... and my free $20 allowed me to win $250 on a slot machine. they essentially payed me to win... who can complain about that?? we scored a bunch of free buffet's from the wheel-o-free-stuff that was outside, and we definitely ate the hell out of that buffet.\n\nthe only major downside is all the construction that is going on next door at the moment... it really kills the whole lay by the pool & relax vibe. you can't relax when you're too busy picking dust & dirt out of your drink, teeth & eyes. if you're looking to lounge by a pool, this is not a hotel for you (at the moment, anyways). it was apparently the windiest day in vegas, ever, and people were freaking out about it. vegas, i laugh at your \""high winds\""... you would most likely fall over if you spent a day in chicago. \n\noverall, i was fine with the monte carlo, even though there were a few cleanliness concerns on my end. i'll probably stay there again until i meet a sugar daddy that is willing to pay for a 5-star.",1565

3,"i stopped in to grab a dessert after lunch and got two cupcakes, one vanilla and one chocolate ($2.50 apiece).  both were quite pretty, but not in an over-the-top-i-don't-wanna-eat-this sort of way.  just piped-on frosting with colored sugar sprinkles and a white chocolate candy center. i had high hopes for these cupcakes since my daughter's birthday is coming up.  the vanilla cupcake had an unexpected texture.  most cupcakes tend to be either airy and melt-in-your-mouth sugary or they are dense and moist.  this one was almost slightly grainy, a tad bit chewy, and crumbled a little too easily.  because of that, i thought i'd perhaps purchased one of the gluten-free cuppies.  i know that rice flour can be pesky in the texture department, so was willing to forgive the texture.  i was sad to discover that the chocolate one was similarly grainy.  i think it just must be the recipe.  flavor-wise, they were both very good and had none of the chemically aftertaste that some cakes have.  the best part of these cupcakes was the frosting, which was thick, buttery, and didn't leave a greasy filim in my mouth.  they definitely had a homemade taste to them that i liked.\n\ni was disappointed that the only breads for sale were sweet fruit breads.  i was hoping to grab a loaf of crusty bread or some yeast rolls, but it was all sugary stuff.  the available choices weren't overwhelming, but there wasn't anything overly exotic, either.  i had hoped for a chai cupcake or maybe a black forest one, but the cupcake options were simpler:  carrot, red velvet, chocolate, and vanilla.  the brochure says special order flavors are available, but there wasn't a list on the brochure or on the website.  i was also unable to locate any mention of what types of ingredients are used.  \n\ni'm not sure we'll be back.  the location is a bit out of the way for a quick dessert and the current selection isn't memorable enough for special orders, although if i'm in the area, i'd certainly consider it.",488

1,"i've been to plenty of jamba juice locations before. but my experience at this particular store was just terrible.\ni came here on a tuesday afternoon at about 2... store was fairly empty with maybe 1 person in front of me and 2 behind me in line. \n \ni thought i'd be in and out in a few minutes as i just b ordered one smoothie, no extras, nothing special. \nbut no... i was left waiting in the store for almost half an hour. \ni would have said forget it and just return my money but no one would come to the counter! \n\n someone behind me was served before me, and the woman in front of me was served after me! also, after they finally finished my smoothie, they left the cup near the hot oven where they were cooking something. i tried to tell them that was my smoothie but they ignored me and let it melt, then 5 minutes later moved my smoothie to the counter where they didn't even call my name. i took a sip and some of it was warm, except the chunks. of powder that weren't blended! \n\n\nalso it's funny to me that the other bad review on this location was pushed into the \""not recommended\"" area.",389
1,i've been coming to the palms pool for the last 3 years and it used to be my go to spot for the pool parties i loved it. however this year management changed. the bartenders are the rudest i've ever seen. the fat guy with the bald head to be exact. they don't play hip hop and no longer bring in hip hop artists there cocktail servers are rude too. it's a shame! i'll never go there again for the rest of my life let alone spend my money there or tip rude bartenders. they all need to get new personalities!,536
