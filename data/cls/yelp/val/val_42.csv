4,"what an adorable set up this place has! great menu with plenty of meat free options too!  was just here for lunch with some coworkers and their meals looked just as tasty as mine. could be a little less over zealous on the soft drinks though. i had taken maybe three sips and they brought me a second glass, so by the end of our meal the table was cluttered with untouched drinks, but i will definitely be coming here after work one day to try some of those beautiful bottles behind the bar!",1588
5,"i love this petco! it is clean, near my house and the staff is awesome! they have adoptions weekly i believe for dogs which is always nice. the staff is very helpful, anytime i need something they are eager to help.",1002
2,"this is definitely the place to be if you are in your 20s because the night life is awesome... however, the rooms are ancient and overpriced, i would definitely just visit, and stay somewhere else... you have to pay for everything! i swear the chairs would collapse underneath you if you don't deposit a money on the hour every hour.  you have to pay for internet....you have to pay $25 for gym access-but apparently you can talk your way down. finally, you don't get a discount in their clubs for staying in their rooms (during the week you are allowed free access, but the weekend is what most people come for).",1471
1,"awful experience, contacted and spoke with the regional manager and was told she would call me back with an answer. never received a call back. this store has many personnel problems.\n\nsorry jcp, i can see why your stock is tanking...",1634
4,"when i lived in california, pho was always one of my favorite rainy day foods because of the warm, comforting feeling i would get after eating a huge bowl of it. on one of those rare rainy days here in vegas, i began to feel a little homesick and decided to try this restaurant. \n\nupon walking in i was greeted by the friendly staff which automatically gave this place a couple stars. customer service is a big part of my dining experience at any restaurant, and this place definitely meets my expectations. i decided to get a bowl of pho with brisket and sliced beef. my order came out quickly and was bigger than i had expected. the broth has a very good flavor and tastes even better with the addition of the bean sprouts, lime juice, and basil leaves. the meat was very tasty and plentiful as well. \n\nwhen i went to the counter to pay my check, i discovered that the huge bowl of pho was only $8.50! the only thing i love besides good food is cheap food. i will definitely be coming back here to satisfy my random pho cravings.",1356
5,"excellent, excellent, excellent.  consistently wonderful service and food.",1417
1,"see what happens when you get rotd'd?? you break the 2 month hiatus of crap review writing and join the world again. i see what's goin on here yelp....:)\n\ntoo bad i chose to review this place. it doesn't get much worse. db and slut central in there. the drinks are weak, the food sucks and they blow this ridiculously loud horn for no apparent rhyme or reason. i'm thinking to myself  \""... did someone leave a fat tip?? was there nipple slippage?? is there a fucking reason this a-hole keeps blowing this stupid horn??\""  answer: no\nit was like being trapped in some never ending frat nightmare....complete with underage girls dressed like prostitutes, slangin' h20 outside. i witnessed the creepiest exchange between one of these girls and some middle aged dood that should've landed him on \""to catch a predator\"". \n\ntrash \ntrash\ntrash\ni won't be back. there has to be a better place to grab a couple of drinks after a game. i'll keep looking.",1072
4,"this place is pretty neat. however, after they moved locations in biltmore fashion i am a little disappointed in what they are trying to display. their stuff has always been very expensive but it was more substance to a lot of their items. where now you can buy a 20 page book for 50 dollars if you are lucky. pretty unrealistic. but it takes money to make your condo look incredible. the staff is like a pregnant woman. depends on what day you are in and what face you are dealing with. ty that works there is a friend of mine but i always see being awesome to everyone that walks in.",469
4,"sadly this show is closing on 1/18/15\nbut if you get a chance to watch, do it! \nthe show is about 4 different ladies all going thru menopause, each have a different reaction to their menopausal symptoms which is what makes it so funny.\nthere is an older cougar celebrity, business woman, a hippie, and a stay at home country mother.",487
4,"pretty good buffet food for a reasonable price, relatively speaking.  lots of neat dishes you don't see everywhere and decor/presentation one notch better than most.  many said service was really bad but it was great for us.  only a few minutes wait too.",169
3,"menu is quite weak, especially for dinner, but it gets the job done. the grilled ham and cheese was very salty, but my buddy had the club sandwich, which he said was really good. the service is quick, and the staff, in general, are positive and friendly. if staying at the four queens, you get a coupon book with a 2-for-1 meal at the binion's cafe, which would probably be the only reason for coming back.",152
2,"cox cable and internet services may not be the best choice when you have options. \n\nthe company is large and they like to use that size to bully more than for improvement of service and services. \n\ni have been a loyal customer for many, many years and year after year my bills change without cause, they like to play up sell games, and even force you to take services you do not need, all in the name of savings. don't be fooled as the savings are always temporary and in the end you always pay.\n\nthis company could be great, increase customer count and be the leader, but they choose to prey on unsuspecting customers, be overbearing in forcing staff to oversell and leave customers disheartened, and worse play the pricing games.\n\nthe people are good, the process is broken and inconsistent and the product is in demand. a simple fix could turn this company's rating the right direction, but only time will tell as technologies change who the winners and losers will ultimately be.",195
3,would have given more stars. service was a little slow. the server was sweet but forgetful. i didn't get a refill on my water. we had to ask for things a few times before it was given to us. the food was pretty good. didn't have much flavor. but the mozzerrla sticks were the best. freshly made you could tell. would i come back? maybe. there are other italian restaurants nearby i would probably choose over it.,1031
5,"very good place to get your nails beautiful. they have new massage chairs, and it's wonderful. my family comes to this place every 2 weeks. love this place!",492
4,"i stayed at the holiday inn near by and after reading the reviews here on yelp i decided to give crackers & company a try. i ordered my standard ham & eggs but i was tempted to have their \""mess\"" which was sos with eggs and a slice of prime rib. the one thing i read in the previous reviews that caught my interest was the country potatoes. i'm always looking for a breakfast place that serves home fries where the potatoes are sliced and fried with onion, it's hard to come by. the review i read said that they sliced their potatoes so i was hopeful. the potatoes did not get fried with onion but they were still great. the ham was a good sized slice and the eggs were cooked perfectly. ok, here's how crackers and company failed to get the 5th star.....the english muffin was not toasted and they buttered it which made it soggy. i didn't send it back because by the time the second english muffin was delivered most of my breakfast would have been eaten. it's not like the restaurant was busy and they were rushing the orders out, i was the second table of the day so there's no excuse for not toasting the english muffin properly. my suggestion to anyone like me is tell your server that you want the english muffin toasted properly. it's a shame that a place that's been called the best breakfast in the phoenix area would have to be told how to toast an english muffin. i'm i just being too picky????",1027
3,put up a $1.99 margarita sign and i'm in. that's why i tried this place. the margaritas are good but since they're only two bucks they're not very strong. really liked their salsa. the food was good but a little salty. i do recommend you try their flan. tasty!,1388
3,"although, it's all the way on the east side - a pretty good haul for me, i've been here a couple times with my son for carne asada burritos.  great flavor all the way around.  \n\nthe only reason i'm not giving more stars is because the asada was really tough and gristly -- both times.  they use cheap meat.\n\ngreat horchata & great salsa!!",408
2,i tried their teriyaki lunch there and although they give you a lot of food it don't taste so great,1092
2,my expectations were high coming in due to the reviews but really was unimpressed with selection and taste. ice cream was eh and cost was high. would rather get ben and jerry's from the local mart.,1688
3,"ce restaurant de d\u00e9jeuners offre plusieurs choix sur son menu, ce qui rend tout le monde heureux \u00e0 chaque fois!",412
3,"cooler than average.\n\nwe live in a desert.  it's hot during the summer.  it's 90 degrees - at night.  people wither in heat like this and so do plants.  lucky for us, we have places like star nursery.  \n\ni can't comment on the depth, breadth or pricing of their products, since i never window shop; i know what i want to buy or i come to ask why my trees are dying but the weeds are 6 feet tall.  the people here are friendly and seem to know what they're talking about (not that i'm a good judge, since my plants and grass never seem to last the season).  \n\nthe best part about star nursery is that their building is clean and cool.  it feels like they use a swamp cooler, but hell, it's a lot cooler than that other place down the street.  in the end, it's so much easier to ask questions or spend money when you're not melting.",1631
5,"oh man, how we love rincon de buenos aires! \n\nwhen you walk in the door of this very unassuming little restaurant/deli/mercado, you'd never expect that this restaurant is home to some of the best asado outside of south america...and it is. i haven't had morcilla or molleja this legit since i spent a summer in uruguay, and it's a good bet that i won't find its equal anywhere else.\n\nrene and mariano always take great care of us; they make sure that bread and chimichurri are never in short supply, and that drinks are always full. \n\nthe noquis (gnocchi) are heavenly, especially with the rosado sauce. tasty, baked empanadas. a half of one lomito completo sandwich will bust my gut - filet mignon sandwich with cheese, lettuce, tomato, ham, and a fried egg. \n\nand then, if you drink yerba mate, they have a great selection of brands that you can buy by the kilo. we're talking canarias and cruz de malta, for 6 dollars. no $8 ten oz bags of fru-fru whole-foods mate here! \n\nto sum up - this is our favorite restaurant in all of las vegas.  eating dinner here was my brother's only request when he came to visit from austin, tx. tell your friends!",139
1,"service was great! food not soo, i ordered the romaine salad and all it was, was a that a romaine head for 12.00 my friend ordered the tortilla soup- what a joke! we were trying to watch what we ate considering we were in cute dresses ready to dance at her club and didn't want to over stuff ourselves. margarita was 20.00. they charge you for your glass of water which you don't even ask for they just bring to you a whooping $4 bucks! oh i forgot i ordered baby clams as an appetizer they were the size of a penny!",184
5,marco is amazing!!! my husband was having problems with his brand new ps4 and he went to the sony store and they switched it out for him with no hassle at all. thank you marco!!!!! now my husband and my daughter can play their video games tonight together and that makes me one happy mama!!! if i could give move than 5 stars i would!!!!,995
3,"huge speed bumps! but hey, i hate speed bumps anywhere. \n\ni dig this shopping center, but dodging the soccer moms in their tank-sized suvs gets a little old. i know it's important for you to go shopping and go buy new yoga pants at target, but come on. you can at least pretend like you were going to stop at a stop sign....and not take a 90\u00ba turn at 45mph.\n\nsome good things here:\n\ntarget\nht\nregal 22\nkabob grill\nflying biscuit\nlatest discovery: true crafted pizza. that place freaking rules.",1034
1,you should never take any computers to be fixed here. they have the poorest customer serveice and they don't do repairs on time. this is not a good business if you work from home with your mac as i do.,475
1,"6&7 july 13\n\ndon't stay here!\ntook an hour to check in. reception desk people are less than friendly. requested extra pillows, given a hard time.  after third phone call they said they were already delivered. not to our room. \nair conditioning unit was absolutely filthy and so was room. shower head was so plugged up was difficult to rinse my hair. \nvery rundown hotel room. no wi-fi either. \nstained pillow cases and sheets. \nrugs in hallway rolled up, stained, and frankly unsafe. \nelevators wreaked of marihuana. \nno room service??? are you kidding me?",476
2,ok the decor is modern and we always wanted to try it out.\n\nfood tasted below average and expensive .period.   my wife got the penang curry and i got the  seafood special.  the seafood alone cost me 21$.  i was hoping for a much better affair both interms of size and taste. it dissapointed me big time. the seafood actually tasted bad. some of the clams did not even open up! my wifes penang curry was not creamy and  she found it very thin.\n\ni would recommend mekong dobson/broadway if you want your thai fix.,456
5,"word is they shop for fresh ingredients locally three times a week to hand make quality waffles daily.  \n\nit sure tasted like it!  \n\ni had the pumpkin waffle with nutella topping.  light crunch on the outside and fluffy inside.  i also enjoyed the original waffle with whipped cream, powdered sugar, and topped with caramel sauce.  \nmy waffle was part of a breakfast special which came with eggs, bacon, and unlimited coffee....perfect way to start the day!  \n\nit felt a little stuffy in this small cafe, but i got used to it.  staff was very polite and helpful, especially with the free wi-fi.  \ni've got my eye on the waffle sandwiches or the waffle pizza for my next visit.",1655
1,"all i can say is this. if the hot shots at the burger king corporate offices had any sense and honestly wanted to look after their customers they would revoke the franchising rights of this place, because it has to be one of the worse places to eat in all of the southwest.",444
1,"i love-love-love dd\""s but this one does not compare to all others.  i don't know what is with their creamer.  it tastes sour.  i have tried a few times but the coffee always seems off.  i drive to the one on new hope even though i live closest to this one.",1074
4,"we've stopped by here from time to time, usually for a bevvy.  \n\nmy favorites of course are diet coke and iced tea.  love their soft-crunchy ice.\n\nthis location is reliable.  they are usually fast, and always accurate.  \n\n\nmy most recent visit was last night around 11pm, for the perpetually starving teen- just picked her up from a friend's house (and i know they fed her dinner).  don'tcha just hate those folks that eat around the clock, are stylishly thin, and can put down a large order of tots without blinking an eye?  me too, usually, 'cept when it's my baby.\n\nthis late night visit included super fast n friendly service on rollerskates, combined w accuracy of order delivered.  piping hot tots, i had two, so i know.  ketchup in the bag, along with 3 napkins.",1046
2,"good food, bad service and please keep your opiinions to yourself!\n\ni visited this bar because i heard about the good atmosphere, food, and the number of tv's for the many sports you can watch.  i favorite thing is that it cooks that good old world italian food.  i lived in kansas city where there is a good amount of italians there and being in arizona that food seems hard to find.  santisit's has that good italian family food packaged in a sports bar and not the traditional italian family restaurant.  kudos for that now on to the next.  \n\ni visited this place twice over the last week and have received bad service and got insulted on the second visit.  on 07/19 with my fiancee.  we ordered a antipasto salad and a stromboli.  we arrived at 3pm and did not receive our order until 3:45.  i believe the only reason we received that because they over heard the conversation that i was going to leave if the food was not out by 3:45.  i was surprised it took so long to bring the food out and especially a salad.  they could have just brought that out first since that was so simple to make.  we were out on lake pleasant that day out in the hot sun for about 4 hours and we grew an appetite.  however, we received the food and it was great.  \n\ni visited this place again on 07/23 for happy hour after doing some after hours work and i felt really insulted by the bartender that day and i didn't finish my food that day.  i arrived at there around 5:30pm and order a michelob ultra and a stromboli again.  keep in mind that i am a heavyset guy and my bartender was a skinny 130lbs older lady probably around in her 50's.  she brings my order and looks at the plate and makes a remark saying, \""that would last me about 3 days\"".  i did not understand why she said that but i paid it no mind until i was ready to go.  i only ate half of the plate and when i asked her to package my plate she makes another remark, \""i'm suprised you didn't eat the whole thing\"".  i left the place shocked and insulted.  it took a lot to keep me from cursing this lady out.  i could not believe that she would inpose her opinion on me because i'm heavyset that i just gouge food.  i know that there is a lot of peope here who gets crazy about this fat phobia but if it does not affect you, the please don't worry about it.  it's my life and i can do what i want to do.  in addition, you are not a medical professional and you don't know why a person is overweight to begin with.  even the doctor's themselves do not completely know what causes a person to be overweight becasue if they did 80 percent of adult americans would not be fat.  \n\nthis bar really pissed me off and i will not ever go back there again.  on the first time, shame on me but a second time, shame on you.  if the food wasn't good i would probably rate this place a one star.  please train your staff to pay attention to your customers and be more couretous.  thanks.",498
4,this is a nice little place.  good variety of eastern european meats. my wife was searching for some items she would eat as a kid and yashas actually carried the items.  they were open on memorial day which was nice.  we will be going back for sure. my wife was looking for mici which isnt exactly carried at safeway.  and they had it in the freezer along with a wide variety of meats.  the bakery items looked awesome. i will have to update my review when we  go back.,406
2,"ok, i am a huge bobby flay fan. i had to go here, so i dragged all my friends along because it was for my 21st bday. we ordered an appetitzer and it was ok. my friend ordered a margarita and it wasn't to our liking.  service was good, but not great. the food was ok, i already got tired of my dish after the 3rd bite.  it was maybe too sweet? too many flavors combining and its not concentrating on one flavor. when bobby cooks on food network, your mouth waters, but at mesa grill...i didn't.  i tried emerils before mesa grill, and loved emerils. but to mention we could order off the brunch menu only.  i looked at the pics from the dinner menu, and they look very good. and i had the spicy chicken potato hash....way too sweeet, and too much.",501
2,"what a huge disappointment - from the bland, expensive burger to the un-pickle that accompanied it.\n\nfor $12 (base burger price) plus $1 (cheese) plus $1.50 (bbq onions), i got a $14.50 letdown.  \n\nsave your dollars and go to margaritaville for a wonderful cheeseburger in paradise (with a delicious pickle to boot) for a much better price.  it's right across the street.  plus, you don't have to deal with the pretension.  bonus.",1091
1,"what can i say other than this place just plain stinks. i usually do not give 1 star ratings but this place had it coming. we went there with friends for dinner and there were several issues. first of all the waitstaff were very snooty and unfriendly. i got the vibe this place was big for the local myers park crowd and the whole atmosphere smelled of rich arrogance, so i was a little put off from the start. secondly, they need to learn how to cook filet, both myself and my buddy ordered the filet, i ordered it medium rare and he ordered it well. the steaks came out cooked identical, both were cooked well done. for a place that seems so arrogant they need to work on their skills in the kitchen to back up the attitude. the third and final insult came with the french waiter there dropped a knife not only once but three times on my wife, all without apologizing. i was beginning to think they were trying to tell us to leave. save your money, you can get a better steak at longhorn without paying a premium.",1396
5,"i'm so sad i didn't discover the herb box sooner. i went for a girl's lunch and was blown away - by the decor, the vibe, the view and the food - and this was during the winter. i can't wait for patio weather because this will become a weekend go-to spot for me. the salads and sandwiches are delicious and the fries and chips - holy moly! they're amazing and you'll get tons of them. the decor is perfectly shabby chic with a traditional twist and i could seriously move in. \n\nif you and your mom and girlfriends love the quaint feel of arcadia farms, give herb box a whirl. it's got the same feel, but more modern. love love love it.",411
3,"it is not \""sushi at the mall\"" or assembly line stuff.  it is still definitely chic, trendy, low-lit, etc.  got a bunch of the 8$ items, and a couple of appetizers.  i think that is probably the best route to go here.  do not come here to load up on food and to  \""feel full\"" unless you're good with exceeding triple digit$ for two.\n\nas a place that wants you to pay more to get more.  here are some items to not get:\n\n-- foie gras --  i know it is a sushi place first, but i hadn't had foie gras in some time anyhow, the presentation of the foie gras plate was nice, with seared tuna as well...  it came off as if the chef put effort in it since it is change from being another sushi plate, but i expect a little bit more of the foie gras itself.  it was good but seemed a lesser grade or maybe cooked in an oil that didn't complement it.\n\n-- o toro (fatty tuna belly) --  good, but not great.  same as the foie gras above in that it kind of misses the mark even though it was good.   it seemed seared very lightly to keep in the oils--it was surprisingly bland and tough for being sold as high grade stuff.  \n\nsaki note:  i have hit some saki here and there.  the \""hou hou shou\"" saki was freakin' good.  it's a great combo of sweet, citrus-y, fragrant, without being overly so in any of those categories and it wont claw at your throat on the way down.",370
5,"this agency was really helpful in getting the right coverages for my new condo and jeep and explaining what all of this insurance wording really means. i recently purchased my first property and needed to talk to someone to understand what i needed so that i don't get too much or too little coverage. i also am not too familiar with how insurance works so it was great to have someone to talk to who could explain everything to me. i had no idea what some of the coverages even meant until i had a conversation with brock. \n\ni got a quote and followed up several times with many questions over 2 weeks before actually opening my policy. after working with brock and some of the staff there i felt comfortable knowing that there is a place i can go to have a discussion about any concerns in person without having to call some 800 number and wait on hold for what feels like an eternity. \n\nfor something as important as my home and car i wanted a place i can turn to for guidance. brock and his team helped me a lot. i now am looking into refinancing my car, getting life insurance, and health insurance too all through this agency. i would have never know an insurance agency would have offfered these things if i didn't walk in to this office a few weeks ago. i would recommend  this place to anyone looking for insurance of any kind and even loans. \n\ngive them a call. it can't hurt.",484
