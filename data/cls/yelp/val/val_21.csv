1,"i've actually had ok experiences at this place in the past but this trip was especially bad. \n\ni tried to stop here with my husband for an appetizer and a drink before heading into the theater district - bad move.  upon being seated the server explained that they were no longer serving food because of a water leak or something unsanitary-sounding. klassy. \n\nfor reasons i truly can't explain, we decided to stay for a beer before heading to our destination. we both threw down a brew nasty, paid and left. unfortunately for olive or twist, the visit would probably be our last.\n\non a positive note, there was an interesting man setting up for what looked like a live acoustic set. his warm-up sounded good but we left before he really got started. \n\n\nwhen it's all said and done, we should have just went to the sharp edge down the street. probably a much safer bet for future endeavors.",206
2,"first off, where are you supposed to park? we found a spot in the back in a tiny parking lot, which then put us in the back entrance of the restaurant which is set up like a long narrow house. we had a group of 7 - and they put us in what i guess would be the living room with bookshelves, a fireplace and a few small tables. which is unique, but where are we supposed to eat? \n\ni ordered a $10 margarita - it was ok. a little tart for my liking. and we all shared the trio which was guac, queso & salsa. this would have been better to share if we were sitting at a table! we all ordered some tacos and honestly no one was impressed! they were fine, but ive had better. the prices were a little on the high side so not sure we'll be back.",350
5,i had the most fantasic dinner there. the service was perfect. the food blew me away. and the wine pairing suggested by the sommerlier we so enjoyable. i can't wait to go back. this is fine dining!,1156
5,copper is by far the best indian food i've had since living in charlotte - we absolutely loved it! the spicy broccoli appetizer is a must have!,265
5,"i want to start my review with a disclaimer: i work beverage at sin city theater where murray is now. i have only rarely worked during his show i normally work the later shows & when you work a show you don't pay much attention to the portions of it when you are normally busy\nthat being said i had worked two or three times during the show at the bar & i did think it was cute from an adult point of view but when i took my son & two other children (plus two more, with 5 total kids in our party) for his 10th birthday i did not realize how much fun we would have. my son said it was his best birthday ever.\npart of it was seeing the show through the eyes of excited happy kids but i liked the things they enjoyed as well. it is up close right there a-volunteer-from-the-audience magic. i know a little bit about magic shows (very little but some) and i thought the tricks were very well performed, the kids came in slightly skeptical but after the first few minutes were like amazed and astounded. kids are hard to excite nowadays & this did it. \nhis routine is also funny and keeps you on your toes, one of the adults with me was a fellow employee & we both giggled along with his jokes. he interacts well with his audience using a good mix of front row/back row volunteers & he did pick some kids (and seniors) which honestly must be horrifying for a performer because kids are capable of anything. \nlefty was great too, as was chloe. the \""sidekick\"" & \""assistant\"" never get enough credit but they really made the show. lefty is cute & funny & chloe is gorgeous & engaging. \nthe kids all want to do magic now which i think is great because we have enough video game players in the world it would be nice to have more magicians. \ni love shows like this because this is what vegas was built on & its good for our community. \nthis show is great for kids because of the size & material it's inspiring to them. you can take your child to a movie on  a screen where they know it's make believe or you can take them to something that inspires them to get out there & learn something. my kids were elementary age but i think older kids too. there were some high school age kids there who were having a great time, one got chosen to go on stage and loved it.\nit is great for adults who want to go to an early show (4pm) and have a slightly ironic laugh and a good time, also great for seniors.",1081
3,"ok, but pretty skimpy sandwich for the price.",237
4,"this location was unexpectedly large. from the parking lot, i would expect this to be the smallest pita jungle location i'd ever seen! however, once you get inside, the restaurant is much larger than expected. it was still packed and busy at lunch time, but i think that has been similar to any other pita jungle i've ever been to.\n\ni met my fiance here for lunch one day, and we were quite satisfied (as usual). nothing spectacular that sets this location apart from the rest, but it didn't disappoint either. we love pita jungle, though, so maybe we're a bit biased! i love how each location is different from the others, too. i loved the style inside the restaurant, although the vibe was a bit hampered by the noise level from our fellow diners. they were playing music, but i could barely hear it over all of the talking!\n\nother than that, no complaints. we had some delicious mango iced tea and our food was quite good. :)",309
2,"i usually eat at pita jungle so i decided to try something new. i got the chicken and hummus with two pitas. while the chicken was good, the hummus seemed kind of bland as compared to pita jungle's. i am willing to give the place one more try and maybe have the gyro next time. also, i believe that pita jungle makes their own pita bread. however, i do not think that this place makes their own bread as it tasted like it was pre- made.",1281
5,"the service is absolutely extraordinary, as are the accommodations. the location is perfect and sure, it's expensive, but you get what you pay for, and then some. to be able to stay in a major hotel on the strip with all the benefits, but also have a silent retreat at the end of the day is truly something special. the staff we encountered truly go out of their way to help you. fantastic stay! we will certainly return in the future.",226
5,"i love their food!!! i'm super addicted. they always make the food fresh to order. my favorite is the spicy chicken. it's very flavorful and has the perfect amount of smokiness to it. i love carbs, and i'm very picky when it comes to rice. i love how they don't use cheap, chinese rice. their white rice makes it even better to eat. i've also had their brown rice. it's really good. i bought a sack of brown rice, and i can never cook it the way they do. :( what i also love about them is their flexibility. they'll pretty much make it just the way you want it, and i'm a very picky girl. one last thing, their salad that comes with the plate is sooooo good. i've never had that type of dressing anywhere else. the lettuce is always fresh, and i am willing to eat it all day everyday. \n\none last thing, their service is always awesome. the owners are very kind. one time, they were out of water cups when i asked for one. he told me they didn't have any more water cups so he just gave me one of those cups you get when you buy a drink. how nice of him! i was honest. swear i only got water. :)\n\nthis place is an example of \""you get what you pay for.\""",144

4,"good to have this restaurant nearby! mostly vietnamese, with a twist of fusion.\n\nwe had fish taco, steak & egg, mekong river style noodle soup and everything was tasty! the ambience was good too.",35
3,"java vegas is the orlean's coffee shop (not to be confused with the cafe) that replaced seattle's best and kate's corner. it is the place to go to for a quick cup of coffee in the orlean's. \n\n at first i was disappointed to see this seattle's best fold. i actually appreciate their coffee more than starbuck's. but things happen. when i saw the java vegas sign at the orlean's sister property: the sun coast, i was kind of concerned that i was in for inferior coffee. when i reached the counter, i saw the familiar green mermaid. in other words, java vegas is a glorified starbuck's with a java vegas banner. \n\n  during my staycation at the orlean's, i visited java vegas twice. with a location near the hotel registration lobby and surrounded by slot machines, people flock to java vegas. the first time there was a long line and the second time their was a wait for an available table. java vegas is well managed and the lines moved fast. the busy employees were friendly. \n\n  although the tables fill up at java vegas, it is a decent size room that overlooks the casino. it is a room of tables and plush chairs that incorporates the space of the former kate's corner.\n\n  java vegas is more than coffee. they sell the traditional coffee cakes and bagels sold at starbuck's.  just like starbuck's, their bagel needs some work. but, java vegas has started selling krispy kreme doughnuts. and a delicious krispy kreme doughnut was a delicious compliment to yesterday's cafe americana.\n\n  being a las vegas local, i could see yelp check-ins at java vegas if i am in the orlean's and need a caffeine boost. its really a starbuck's with decent prices and krispy kreme doughnuts.",1105
4,"fun, bright service. the french onion soup is pretty standard and good. the signature burger was delish with a nice big patty cooked to order and the mix of a sweet white chocolate with salty fried onions make this a better than average burger. unfortunately it was served with fries that weren't hot or fresh.\nthey have a very fun and extensive dessert menu that i couldn't find online. highly recommend the pb&j donuts. little puffs of love filled with warm peanut butter and strawberry preserves dip. the cost with no beverages was about $50. a little pricey, but we enjoyed it. tip - breakfast is only served until 11am .",190
1,"==the last time i visit this fucking guitar center==\n\n--a tragicomedy in one act by jetta.--\n\n(the bass room of a guitar center. jetta, an odd yet striking woman in her early twenties, peruses the assorted overpriced bass guitars and bass amplifiers. underneath a veneer of exquisite beauty lies a hidden feeling of sadness and disappointed. perhaps distressed, she flags down a guitar center employee sporting a ponytail.)\n\nguitar center employee \nis there something i can help you with?\n\njetta\nyes, i'm looking for an upright bass.\n\nguitar center employee \nan upright bass? what do you mean?\n\njetta\nyou know, a double bass. a classical one. like in the picture over there.\n\n(jetta motions to a promotional still of jimbo wallace, bass player of rev. horton heat, holding an upright bass. it is prominently displayed on the wall.)\n\njetta\nlike the kind they use in rockabilly.\n\nguitar center employee\noh, you mean a fretless bass. we have one right over here.\n\njetta\nno, that's a fretless bass guitar. i want an upright bass. you know, they're kind've shaped like cellos. i know there isn't one in the room, i was wondering if i could special order one through you. or just go through the website.\n\nguitar center employee \num, er, i don't know. let me check.\n\n(guitar center employee exits. jetta sends a few text messages. he returns.)\n\nguitar center employee\nwe don't have any of those in the back. \n\njetta\ncan i order one through your website? or should i go through musician's friend?\n\nguitar center employee \num, i'm not sure. you could try both i guess. \n\njetta\ni think i'll just go to sam ash and see if they have one. thanks though.\n\n(jetta breaks eye contact, effectively ending the conversation. guitar center employee does not get the hint.)\n\nguitar center employee \ncan i help you with anything else? maybe a new bass amp. we do have some acoustic bass guitars in the acoustic room. would you like to look at one of those?\n\njetta\nno thanks. it's not really the same, you know.\n\nguitar center employee\nso what kind of music do you play?\n\njetta\nthe kind that you need an upright bass for.\n\nguitar center employee \noh.\n\njetta\nexcuse me, i need to walk past you.\n\nguitar center employee \nwell if you need anything, my name is--\n\njetta\ni need you to get out of my way.\n\n(jetta, enraged, storms off, the clicking of her heels echoing throughout the whole store. guitar center employee looks around and sees a teenager playing with a brand new b.c. rich while their parent looks on. he walks over to them as the curtain goes down.)",534
1,the ham and biscuit sandwich is horrible and need to be take off the market. the people's money need to be refunded its too salty. we were so disappointed when we had to get this on our layover and had to get directly on the plane.,1121
5,"went here on the groupon. had a nice experience this salon is huge. amy h. cut and did some color, the blow dry was extra and honestly blow drys make me fall asleep with my long hair. she was super friendly and liked what she did. worth the money.",528
2,"last night i went back to havana cafe with a groupon and wasn't as excited when i left.  for starters we get there and go to ask for a table and get wait time and the head of the house says it's like 20-30 min wait you sure you want to wait and we said yes that's fine and he goes ok and walks off shaking his head.  we were a little caught by surprise as that's not very professional but whatever he wasn't the cook.  so we sit down and wait and notice he is trying to get people to not wait and leave every single party that came up asking for a table as a matter of fact.  many of us waiting have started to laugh at how horrible this guy is.  he even went as far as saying ya it's over a 30 min. wait so i wouldn't wait if i were you.  omg really??? i hope the owner reads this and does something because if that was my restaurant i would be pissed.  \n\nanyways on to the meal.  laura a. and i shared the tapas sampler which was good it comes with a tamal cubano which was excellent, some chorizo and vegetables, frituras de frijoles, maduros fritos, bacalaitos fritos, and a couple croquetas.  it was perfect for the two of us to share but there was a lot of fried on the plate which wasn't as much variety as we would hope for.  \n\nwe both finished the meal with coffee she got the caf\u00e9 cubano which was a sweet espresso and i went with the moro castle which had dark rum, bailey's and butterscotch schnapps combined with cuban coffee it was a nice way to end the evening and enjoy with dessert which we shared a coconut flan with mango sauce.  the dessert was good not great though i am a huge flan fan and i have had better.  \n\nso overall i would say the meal was a 3.5 but the front of the house being so rude knocked it all the way down to a 2.  pretty sad after i had given it a 4.5 on my last trip.",1182
2,"good service...horrible food.  i really don't know why it's almost 4 stars, and you'd think they would have great oysters since its specialty is oysters.  i ordered the dozen oysters, which smelled fishy once they laid the platter on the table.  the shells were yellowish green like it was bad.  i decided not to knock it unless i tried it, and yep i was right. the oyster was small and sour. definitely not worthy of $13. i then ordered the clams, which were ok.  it was big & meaty, but the sauce was so bland--it killed it.   it came with corn and sausage which was basting in the same flavorless sauce.  i was really disappointed in how everything tasted after the long awaited anticipation.  there was nothing wrong with the service.  the staff was friendly and attentive,  but i would never recommend this place to friends because of the food.  sorry, just being honest.",567
3,better than subway but nothing special.,275
3,"i wish i could give this place more stars because the food is delicious, but the service is terrible!\n\ni brought several people to this establishment to have lunch or dinner  over the last few months and the service is typically a 5. never once has the server been attentive! one time, on a late business lunch, we watched our server sit at a few tables away and completely ignore our stares for the check. we literally waited half an hour as she chatted with other patrons. it was quite annoying to say the least, tips are earned not required! i mean come on! to this day she eyes me down when i come in for pick-up.\n\nthe chicken katsu is the best item on the menu! i would definitely order take-out, at least you can rely on that service. very nice lady at the front!",164

1,"we visited the warm spring location today, and our first time visit to firehouse sub was very dissatisfying and unpleasant. we order a carry out order and found a long strand of hair embedded inside between the meat and the bread, which was awfully disgusting. we have to spend extra time in driving back to the location for an explanation from the store manager name stephen. we spoke to stephen regarding our order and he did not try to solve this issue and simply tell an associate to make us another sub (the same associate who probably dropped  long curly hair in our sub in the first place!!). we felt unwelcome for showing him our issue on the order, his reaction showed that it has happened before and he was not surprise at all. we did not receive a formal apology from him or his associates. he was giving us bad attitudes and facial expressions, it was very disrespectful. we expect a store manager to be properly train to handle and resolve issues, but his actions showed that he does not care for his customers or opinions in improving food hygiene for this store location.  i believe his overall customer service was extremely dissatisfying. our only reason for going back to the store was to receive an apology and explanation, not simply remaking our original order. he did not take the time to look at the sub and try to hide his mistake. at the end, we refuse his offer and got a refund. before this first time visit, we heard great reviews and recommendations about firehouse sub; therefore, we did look forward to eat a high quality sub at firehouse. however, we did not see any of the \""great reviews\"" from our first visit. it was a great disappoint!",42
