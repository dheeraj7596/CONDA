5,Cafe Davio...ahhhhhhh.  I have bben delighted to many breakfasts and dinners here.  First breakfast.  It is not fancy but has serveral nice touches and menu items.....it is less expensive and beats out the local south side  competition as well as the national chains.\nNow dinner.  The quality and care that goes into the food is remarkable...and the protions are huge!  The menu has a slight seafood bent to it which is nice because Pgh lacks good italian seafood.  The waitstaff is very helpful giving very personal service.   Try and you will be raving!,400849
5,"This is a perfectly awesome sports bar.\n\nYou can go there for any big game for any sport, and they will have it on one of their many screens WITH SOUND!!  They even have a roll-down projection screen towards the rear of the bar that shows the big games as well.\n\nI recently went to Picassos one week night, and ordered a beer and an order of a dozen Cajun Garlic wings w/ranch.  This is a tasty sauce I've had many times so I knew what I was given.  The wings were brought to me pipping hot and the ranch was thick and cold.  There's nothing I despise more than a warm, runny ranch.  The wings were cooked with the perfect amount of crispiness but were not overcooked by any means.  \n\nMy only complaint with the wings is that they are not charred.  I'm sorry to say, but if you're not throwing your wings over an open-flame and charring them at this point then you're simply behind the times.  Plenty of establishments such as Fanz, Hickory Tavern and Mac's throw their wings over a grill before serving them.\n\nIf your looking for a chill and relaxing WEEKDAY evening to watch your favorite team, Picassos is the perfect place.  On football Sundays, Picasso's University is nothing short of perfectly organized mayhem.  Fans often arrived at 11am-11:30am even though their game doesn't kick-off until 1pm!  Furthermore, you are very likely to see a skirmish or a squabble as Sunday day turns into Sunday evening and patrons start to get that liquor courage. \n\nBefore I close, I want to make an important distinction in my rating.  I give Picasso's Sports Cafe as a whole  5-stars.  The staff is always friendly, prompt and efficient.  However, I am not giving their Cajun Garlic Wings 5-stars!  Though their wings are good, there are not \""5-star\"" worthy.  On a scale of 1-10, I'd give them a 7.\n\nAt its soul, this is a classic, American sports-bar.  Good food, done right.",9641
5,Had a fun time at the Phoenix Zoo with the kids yesterday.,16641
3,"If you go in for theme restaurants,this one is tops. A neat place to take people--if you can,ask to sit inside one of the boats!  Kids love this place.But be forewarned-if you are having a nice lunch or dinner in one of the 'boats',you may get some uninvited company in the form of rambunctious children who don't belong to you wanting to play on it(We did!!) -but that's more about the parents of said children.\nThis is definitely a fun place-nice bar,and a store attached when you are done eating or waiting to do so. Overall, I think the drinks are good,the food is fine,-it's good,just not great. The nachos are huge,as in tall. I've had better food-it's a bit more hype than substance in some ways. The wait staff seems to be very friendly.",298700
1,"Expensive gimmick.  Missleading website.  Wide angle lens camera makes it look big but is smaller than my kitchen.  For $25 dollars to get in, it was a real disappointment.  We felt ripped off.  Plus the free drink was absolutely aweful; it reminded me of the trash can parties we went to in college.",356065
2,"every time someone recommends the place, I cringe, unfortunately in the area, it's about the easiest place to dine, that being said their pizza (the only thing on the menu) is terrible, i truly prefer the crap thy used to serve us in middle school.\n\nMy tip, drink a lot before going so that you don't care about the state of the food",343716
4,"Margaritas were tasty but a little light on the booze.  Complementary chips and salsa were better than average.  Even though we didn't get any food the waiter still brought us a white chocolate with pecan mini tamale for desert at no charge.  Nice touch, just for that kind gesture I'll come back to eat.",13482
2,Wanted some of those huge souvenir cups everyone was carrying around. Specifically the Eiffel Tower one since it was different than the boring rest. Got a non-alcoholic strawberry frozen drink thingy. It was good but couldn't finish it. Was it 11 or 13 dollars? I forgot. The price isn't too bad. Service sucked asss.,314472
4,"Thanks guys! U did a great job on the baby shower cake, it came out so pretty. The cake itself was very tasty, everyone loved it. Strawberry banana was definitely the best!",310943
2,"We decided on Blue Restaurant for Charlotte Restaurant week as I had heard from several friends and colleagues how excellent the food was.  I have to say, the best part was the complimentary valet parking!  We arrived on a Saturday night at 7pm, thinking the restaurant would be packed, only to find it about a quarter full.  Did we go to the right place?  From what I had heard, I expected there to be a line out the door like there was both times we went to Chima for past Restaurant Weeks.  It's a nice looking place, very open yet cozy, and it has a great bar area.  The server, John, was great and took good care of us, so no complaints there.  It was the food that was lackluster, and for the money, I wish we had gone elsewhere.  The bread was fresh and a good start (2 kinds, and a spread with olives as well as an oil and balsamic vinaigrette to wet it down). The Fattouch salads were good, though I question the use of iceberg lettuce for presentation as it looked like a low end salad with some red peppers, olives and a nasty tomato thrown in.  My partner had a Flat Iron Steak which he ordered medium well and got medium rare.  The first few bites were good, but it toughened as it cooled, and he had some difficulty cutting it as well as the asian broccoli (which he gave up on).  Being a vegan, I wasn't sure I would find anything to eat, but i did see a Mushroom Bolognese pasta dish that I ended up ordering.  It had a great taste, but the homemade pasta was a bit al dente and stuck together.  More like the wide rice noodles in some asian dishes.  Still, I enjoyed mine.  No vegan desert option for me (fresh fruit option, please?), but my partner ordered the chocolate cake and said it was good but very rich.  It all seemed to disappear, though, so that says something!  Overall, a decent dining experience, if we were spending maybe $40-50 max, tip included.  $30 each plus 2 iced teas ($6.98) and tip came to just under $90.  At least I felt like I got my one's worth with the valet at $5 for a tip, it saved me $1 off parking myself and then walking a block!  Still, I'm not sure we will be back anytime soon.  With all the great dining our city has, I think there are better choices for the money...Ilios Noche comes to mind for great atmosphere, service and menu selection at about $20-25 less, and then we could still catch a movie!",7016
3,"Coffee and Wine Bar? Yes please and thank you! I came in for a simple coffee and bagel one morning and found loads of seating, a refreshingly unpretentious coffee shop with interesting fliers and of course, a wine bar. If only AM wine drinking were socially acceptable...\n\nPrices were comparable to any other coffee place and there are multiple rooms to lounge in. While I was sipping away my cousin told me they are a new location for local produce pick up which is really neat, and their wine tasting class schedule makes me wish I lived closer. Apparently all the cool kids go here - just one more reason to see and be scene at the CCCC.",223339
3,"It's not often I find myself on Murray Ave, but i was meeting a friend over at BRGR for lunch and took the long way. I was at a red light when I noticed a parking spot near this bakery. Not too often you can get a spot on Murray right near the place you're going to, so I took it as a sign.\n\nI'd been here before, the first time was late on a Sunday afternoon, when I walked in just about everything was sold out, I had my mouth watering for texas toast made with  Allegro's 12 grain whole wheat bread. Damn Like Seinfeld, someone ahead of me got the last loaf. I settled for a regular whole wheat. I really enjoyed it. \n\nThis time I was lucky and got the 12 grain I wanted. This bread is pretty amazing with lightly browned smoked tofu, charred arugula, peppered greek olives, and veganaise. No vegan restaurant makes a sandwich like that.(Thanks Deb! She's my dietician)\n\nI need to get my butt out of bed early one day and get up there when I have the entire bakery at my whim!",77420
4,"I am far from expert in this field of  sushi but I've tried a fair amount at a fair number of places, and I thought this was exceptional. I already liked the Korean food at the predecessor C J B Korean establishment and now I have a new favorite place for sushi as well.  \n\nBlack suspended tile ceilings with dark concrete floors, walls of bright green and some modern oriental art in between. Slightly spare, clean, modern feel to the place.  Men's room was spotlessly clean, modern with up to date fixtures, stocked with all the necessities. \n\nOur young server was friendly and attentive and our water glasses never went dry - except when I bumblingly knocked mine over, which was taken in stride by staff, and quickly replaced with a fresh glass. Service, from being seated, to order taking, to delivery food, to delivery of the check, involved no undue delays.  In fact, as Norm R noted,  service was almost too efficient as servers were anxious to whisk away our plates almost before we cleared them, but I'll take that over that experienced by another reviewer any day.\n\nNow as to the FOOD, Excellent in every way.  Beautifully presented, multiple distinct flavors. Best shumai ever tasted. Tongue tantalizing tuna tataki, rich, red, flavorful, and our accidental order, the \""OhYa I Forgot\"", was a definite \""no regrets\"", the closest thing to a dessert sushi I've ever encountered with its touch of peach.  \n\nAnd finally, we didn't go away hungry, indeed as one should not from a $65 + tip meal for two, but you need not spend nearly so much.  There are considerably reduced happy hour prices and several \""chef's surprise\"" samplers at under $20. \n\nThe service we received was \""comfortable\"", perhaps more friendly than polished, and that's just fine by me.  I highly recommend with the hope the service you receive is as good as we got, and not the indifference experienced by another recent reviewer below.",234123
2,"I usually order from another place but they don't deliever to my work place. I gave Chop Wok a try after a suggestion from a fellow employee.  I ordered 2 Shrimp Dishes.  Both I felt were disappointing and for what I payed I was expecting more.\nI got mostly a box full of veggies smothered in gravy  with 4 shrimp,  and a carton of overcooked noodles 3 shrimp and about 50 watercrests. ( not that I dont like them it's just it was almost all there was in the box with the noodles. )\n\nI think from now on Ill stick to my local place instead and bring their food with me to work.",600105
1,"terrible service!  the only advantage of this liquor store is it's close to the strip.  I went there to buy some liquor on a friday night and after I left the store, I couldn't find my phone.  So I called my cellphone to see if it's somewhere in my car.  The phone wasn't shut off and it wasn't in my car.  So I decided to call back the liquor store.  the person said they didn't find any phone.  Then I asked if I can come back and check myself.  The person said sure but insisted they didn't find my phone there.  However, when I called my phone again right after I told them I was coming back to check, it was shut off.  I don't know if it was just a coincidence or they were scared of my phone might ring when I come back to check and call it again.  And just to be fair to them, I clearly remembered talking on the phone with one of my friends before heading over to the liquor store.  So the chance that I lost my phone in the liquor store is very highly! On top of that, the liquor is ghetto as hell and doesn't have plastic cup for customers.  What kinda of a liquor store is it if it doesn't even have cups?\nDon't go there if you don't want to lose your phone !",65640

5,The happy hour is wonderful enjoy the steak and eggs and the shrimp cocktail go for a dollar 99 I'm good to be having dinner at 6 so I'll have to the review later but the food is anything like the happy hour we're going to have a great evening.,617765
1,"I was in town for a national healthcare related conference hosted at Caesar's Palace in Las Vegas. I had never been to Las Vegas before this, nor have I ever gambled. I flew in a day early and stayed at a Marriott in Henderson. I spent the next day hiking to the Hoover Dam and some nearby mountains.\n\nI had a rental car. For a first-timer, the Strip is a little daunting. After some maneuvering, I found Caesar's Palace. I didn't know they had free valet service and wouldn't you know it, the free parking garage is a loooong walk from the check-in desk. \n\nWhen I checked in I made a grave mistake that only someone who has never been to Vegas makes. I didn't tip the registration person before I checked in. This guaranteed me the worst room available at that time. I hadn't done enough homework on the nuances of Vegas. I would be paying for my initial error many times over again during my stay.\n\nI asked if there was a cart I could use to haul my week's worth of clothing and tradeshow materials to my room. I was curtly told that wasn't possible, but I could employ a staff member to do it for me. I declined. Even though it was going to be an ordeal to carry all of it through the floor of the casino, I could physically handle it. I was in the Roman Towers. It took three trips.\n\nAfter I checked in the room, I took a shower. The room itself was a nice size. I had a view of an interior courtyard rooftop. There was no door on the bathroom. There was a handset phone next to the toilet, more antiquated than quaint.\n\nA small TV screen was next to one of the sinks. The bath tub was large and in-charge. \n\nI went downstairs and signed up to get a player's club. I also signed in on FourSquare and was given a free buffet at Lagos as a special. \n\nI told them I had never gambled before and they took their time answering my questions. You can't buy chips with a credit card, but there are ATM machines all around that take plastic. You don't even need to know your pin number (you just pay a higher fee).\nI had set my limit at $100. When I withdrew it, I got a hundred dollar bill (instead of 20s). Next to the ATM is a machine which will turn your $100 bills into smaller denominations. \n\nI found a helpful young lady at the small concession stand near the parking lot elevator who gave me a map of the facility.\n\nI had dinner at the Noodle restaurant by the lobby elevator. The d\u00e9cor is a shocking white pattern with mirrors reflecting light into your eyeballs which still maybe adjusting from the dimness of the casino floor. They had massive fish tanks filled with thousands of goldfish.\n\nThe beer that says draft on the menu is not what we in America consider a draft. It was a weak beer in a bottle and draft was the brand. The noodle dish was okay, but average isn't what I want from Vegas dining, not at the price for my dinner.\n\nAll night I was roused through vigorous banging on the hotel wall at random times. Several thumps were hard enough to shake my bed. In the morning there was no cold water in the shower. Thankfully the bathtub had a hand-held shower extension and I could bathe there. That was the only morning that the shower's cold water didn't work.\n\nI discovered my room shared a wall with the servant's elevator and work room. That is what had made the noises the night before (and every night at random times during my entire stay).\n\nI ate each morning at Lagos and each time, it was excellent (except the last day). They have two lines. If you are a diamond or seven club member, there is no waiting. Otherwise, come at the wrong time, and the line looks like a crowd waiting for a Disney ride. I arrived early enough (8AM) each day that there was no line. Typically by the time I left, folks were accumulating, much more so on the weekend.\n\nThey had wonderful lox, capers and other delights. The waitstaff, almost to a fault, was exceedingly attentive. The only negative experience was when I asked to see if my friend had arrived before I did for our meal. I was told to look from the door but was discouraged from entering to see if he was indeed there.\n\nOn our last morning, the buffet had turned from being breakfast into being a 'brunch'. What that meant for us much greater cost and almost none of the good food we'd been enjoying all week. Lox were gone, and most of the regular breakfast items were either low or out. \n\nAnother friend of mine who arrived separately was incredulous that we didn't know the tip rule. He had the same level of room reserved as we did (same conference) and tipped the front desk $50 on check-in. He was given a palatial, presidential suite. \n\nYou can smoke in Vegas casinos. I don't mind second hand smoke, so it didn't bother me.\n\nThe TV doesn't get many channels other than Caesar/Las Vegas promos/Asian ones. The internet is woeful and expensive, but I didn't expect anything else. I brought my Sprint hotspot and was getting 4G almost everywhere.\n\nThe pool is nice, but randomly, private parties bar all but diamond/7 stars.",236454
5,"I drink coffee like it's my job. Columbia Street Roastery is definitely the place to go to buy coffee or espresso beans. Not to mention, SUPPORT LOCAL BUSINESS! \n\nThey carry a variety of flavors, decaf / caf, blends ...and there are quite a few choices when it comes to Fair Trade or Organic.  \n\nLooking for something to do on a Saturday? They offer tours of the plant. And complimentary tastes!   \n\nDuring the summer months, they have a booth setup at the Lincoln Square Mall's Farmers Market too.",271067
3,"I desparately wanted to love this place, after recommendations from the hotel, a bunch of website, open table and yelp...\n\nunfortunately, my husband's fresh fish of the day (Halibut).. lacked flavor (even basic salt) and the oomph we hoped to find at a top-rated expensive restaurant. \n\nWe went here for our third anniversary-- and although my cod with porcini was tasty, it was nothing spectacular.\n\nCalimari was also very basic-- but I dont think there is anything you could really do with calamari-- however, I would like to comment that it was not overly chewy and very fresh.... \n\nOur service was impeccable and the the ambiance is delightful... BUT, I dont think I would be back, and if you are into picking a place for its great \""look\"" and nice area, then go...\n\nbut dont expect an amazing culinary experience-- just a decent one...\nbecause it was a good experience, just not the best.",336642
2,"This store has been bought out by the people who own Bombay restaurant, and is primarily an Indian grocery now. I really miss Euro Mart.",12497
2,"I had a hankering for thai food a couple weeks ago and found these guys on Yelp.  I ordered about 40 bucks worth of various dishes... shrimp pad thai, green curry chicken, spring rolls, a thai iced tea and I think that was it.  I don't remember all that well because most of the food went into the trash.  The iced tea was about the only thing that was exceptional.  Everything else was pretty much blah.  Not a lot of meat, and the curry was super greasy.  The pad thai was dry and tasted like it was anything but fresh.  My quest for GREAT thai food continues.  The one thing that surprised me is that when I went to pick up my order, their dining room was packed with lunch guests.  Maybe I just ordered the wrong dishes (???)",227668
3,"I thought this place was pretty average as far as Chinese food goes.  Decided to try it out because other reviewers mention the plethora of vegetarian options.  On the menu itself there are no more vegetarian options than most Chinese places offer.  However, they will vegetarian-ize most of the meat dishes (I got General Tso's Tofu).\n\nThat said, it was not the greatest tofu I've had--kind of mushy, sauce was a bit watery (...or oily...honestly I couldn't tell which).  It also was not spicy at all.  I'm sure they'll make it spicier if you ask, so if you like your food spicy you should probably request it.  My food tasted alright and was definitely a generous portion, plenty for leftovers.\n\nService was quick and the place looked clean.  The food was just very...average.",11813
3,"Stayed 4 nights for business. Overall the hotel was ok. Front desk staff indicated our room was a \""suite\"" with two double beds, despite requesting a king.The room was clean, but small things like chipped lamps, missing paint, small hole in the drapes and an unsuccessful attempt to cover a mark on the wall was disappointing. The AC would make a big \""clank\"" when it cycled on. \n\nStaff is very, very friendly, pool was nice and the location is great-across from a ton of restaurants. The beds were comfortable. Unfortunately the rest of the room wasn't much to call home about.",6723
3,"My best friend has been raving about the $28 ounce of kobe from Cut and how great it was (his gf didn't let him eat it after she tried it) and so I've wanting to try Cut for a while.  I'm not a big fan of steak houses but thought Cut would be different.  For the record, I didn't order the $28 an ounce kobe, I did order a dry aged new york sirloin.  It was a big piece of meat and that's what it was.  It was dry, flavorless, and very average.  I just wasn't impressed.  The wasabi-yuzu sauce was a nice compliment for the steak since it gave it some flavor.   For appetizer, I had heirloom tomato salad which I again thought was very average.  The salad was $21 and the steak was $59 and I don't think it was worth it.  For that same price, I could have ate somewhere else and probably had a tasting menu of some sort.  There wasn't anything spectacular about the meal, it just felt like over priced steak and salad.  \n\nThe service was relatively good, they were attentive and courteous.  The decor was somewhat depressing.  Perhaps they were going for the dim lighting of a steakhouse which is fine but I felt it didn't go well with the chairs and tables.\n\nThere were three of us and the bill was $336.  We had some alcohol and also a souffle for dessert which was so so.  My best friend has said that he and I will go to Cut together next time I visit him.  I think I'll have to find another restaurant to try instead.",309057
4,Very much enjoyed my dinner at Carpe Diem. \n\nI had a tasty scallop dish albeit a bit small portion wise and two delicious starters - the tuna and calamari. I was happy in the end that I did get appetizers or my meal might have been a bit small. The real stand out was the fresh bread- wow delicious..I literally couldn't stop reaching for another roll - even after I was full! \n\nOur server was friendly and attentive- he recommended a nice chardonnay for my dinner and was pleasantly surprised it was in the $8 range.The atmosphere was a little stark- nicer for a quiet date than a girls night. \n\nOverall id say bring your wallet- my meal with two drinks and an appetizer was about $60. I would absolutely visit again since everything was really yummy!,7464
1,"The restaurant seemed nice at first appearance.  Appetizer -chicken potstickers were great.  The bowl size  wasn't too big. It was $9.99 a bowl  (dinner)and make bottom less bowl  ( repeat bowls) was another 4 dollars.  Not  a lot once cooked.  Could have cooked a little longer as broccoli was still completely hard and not even warm.   And the initial bowl is small.  For family of 4, it was expensive  for amount of food.  I was very excited for the restaurant to open up,  but overall  disappointed.  Felt like we rush thru the  entire process and  rushing us out the door.  Won't go again",606474
4,"So I stayed at Encore last year for CES and the place had just opened. Didn't have a great experience. They lost my luggage the first night when I left it with the bell boy, checking out was a nightmare, ordering food and having basic things in the room (like a pen) proved too difficult... but I must say they redeemed themselves this year.\nI stayed in the tower suites this time around for CES and would highly recommend it. The suite is huge... 2 bathrooms, a massage room, living room, bedroom... way more space than I needed. The staff were very sweet, the concierge was great with reservations and checking out was very easy. The separate entrance is key if you don;t have a limo because it makes getting a cab much easier (and you avoid the ludicrous lines that exist at the main casino entrance) and check out is much faster. \nThe gym fee is a little ridiculous but that's just standard Vegas so it's not specific to Wynn/Encore.  \nLast thing -  one day the maid threw out bags that I had left in the middle of my bathroom... she thought they were trash. Except they contained the shoe bags and receipts from several pairs of beautiful new shoes I had bought. She threw them out by accident. Obviously I was pissed... but they were very professional dealing with it and went back the store and sent up 5 sets of Louboutin and Sergio Rossi covers after they realized what had happened (and who am I kidding... I wasn't going to return the things :) Throwing out the bags - not cool - but the way they dealt with it was very professional and very much appreciated. \nOverall, I like Encore more than Wynn and it is definitely one of my go to hotels when i go to Vegas.",321796
5,"I've made several trips to Indonesia over the years and this is the first place in the States that serves food comparable to the fare I had there..

1,"It was my first time boarding my dogs of 6yrs. I was very nervous and saw that they have great reviews but I was unsure. The staff seemed very pleasant.  I came to drop my dogs off and asked to see where they would be kept. I was met with a  bit of hesitation despite it being an option.. They took me back through the \""Bahamas' room which they said to put them in, I was very uncomfortable walking through, dogs looked dirty and were going crazy. It had the feel and appeal of a humane society. They thankfully took me through to a quieter room \""Maui\"" and put them in a kennel run, that was indoor/outdoor. I left them their dog pillow and uncomfortably left.\n  \nWhen I returned to pick them up, the lady called in back and requested them picked up from Bahama's! I hope not!  When my dogs came out they were dirty and smelled horrible. The dog pillow was filthy and stunk I almost wanted to throw it in the dumpster (I wish I had during the car ride ). When I put them in the car,  my boyfriend and I gagged automatically. We had to pull over because the smell was so bad I thought I was going to puke.  :(  I washed the dogs and the pillow cover asap, but it took some scrubbing to get the grime off. \n\nI do not know what went on but I am horrified by this.  I look back on the reviews and they are mostly about the Veterinary side. My  mistake!\nI WILL NEVER TAKE THEM HERE, and I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND!",306553

I could eat that all on its own. I ordered it with the fried pork chop, which came with the traditional gravy --- delicious. The maduros and boiled yucca were prepared just the way I like it. The garlic sauce for the yucca was potent . . . but again, that's just the way I like it.",347847

2,"I passed by this place several times and was curious and stopped in for lunch one day. It is a nice clean place with friendly service. I had a chicken wrap with house dressing. It was a huge wrap, but not very tasty. I ate one third of it. The baked beans and potatoes salad were not very good either. I regret not having just plain chicken or ribs. They looked and smelled good. I'm not sure that I will go back because the television was on Fox News. I could never sit through that again. Public places should never have televisions on stations that may offend their customers. It would have been better to have it off.",74394
1,"Zoe's is probably not a place to go if you are a Vegan. Actually, it's probably not a place to go if you are a T-rex either. When it comes down to it, this chain is no better than Chik-fil-a in what it offers. At least with Chik-Fil-A I get my food quickly and a nice side of cross-cut fries.\n\nZoe's Kitchen sits across the street from My Florist which, when you really think about it, was a dumb move on corporate's part. Both look to provide healthy food options in a market of fast food and grease. The problem is that, despite My Florist's problems, it is local, more diverse, and doesn't make you feel like you are eating in an Ikea showroom.\n\nThe food is just bad. My chicken sandwich was dry. Drier than the Mohave dry. I'm trying not to dive into other forms of hyperbole but this chicken was born and raised inside a Popiel Food Dehydrator. The least they could do would be to provide me with some mayo to fix things up a bit.\n\nThere's another one of these over on Camelback, it may or may not be better, but as far as our downtown one goes, this place will never see me or my money again.",14442
3,"This was the first time I have been able to attend the Brazilian Festival and I have been wanting to come now for a long time. So glad I came because I will not be returning next year.\n\nThe location is great, there's lots of space and parking available. They have the stage set up in the middle where they give great performances and have plenty of room where you are able to dance along with them if you want. They also have plenty of retail vendors and of course a small somewhat decent play area for the kids. \n\nThe food however, well I am very disappointed in that. Not enough food vendors, I believe there was only about 8-10 vendors. The Only vendor I recognized was Texas de Brazil, I did order their 3 meat sampler for $7, which of course was juicy and tender as I know their food is delicious. As for everything else, well, not impressed. I also ordered my Caipirinha for $6, which was ok. \n\nAll I'm saying is that for being a Brazilian Festival they should really have more food. The entertainment is good, the kid area can definitely improve. My suggestion, get your tickets through Groupon as you get a great value to attend and it won't feel like a waste of money when you too feel disappointed.",591841

5,"I don't do caffeine anymore, or calories for that matter... so this is my fave place to eat yummy & healthy guilt free food!\n\nThey can make pretty much any tea you can think of- I used to love chai(but I'm off caffeine, remember?) so now I always get the vanilla rooibus tea  with soy milk & a little splenda of course.  And I love their roasted chicken salad for lunch.  Something about the way they make it- I wonder what the secret ingredient is!\n\nBest part- when you get a salad or sandwich, you can add on a large tea of coffee for just $1.\n\nWhat more can you ask for?",368317
