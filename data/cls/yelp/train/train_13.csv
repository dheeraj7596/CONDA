5,"Stopped in here on my way home one day looking for a vaporizer.  The place was clean and well lit, and by the time I started lookinh near the vaporizors some one came over to see if I needed any help. He answered my questions and didn't pressure me or try to upsell me, and steered me away from a couple he didnt think I would enjoy. I'll definitely be back for more hardware if needed!",432258
2,"So I tried Over Easy for a third and final time. It's been a few years..and it's a different location. Annnnd the fianc\u00e9 wanted to try it because he had never been. We both ordered mimosas. I had a pomegranate flavored and he had a Bellini flavored. Both came in glasses filled with ice, which was strange.. and both were soooooo sweet and sugary. They weren't what we expected but they had alcohol in them.. So we drank em. He ordered chicken and waffles and I ordered the Benedict with biscuits and sausage instead of the traditional. His was OK.. The chicken was cooked well but very small portion. Not a lot to it. My dish was not good. The biscuits were stale and crumbly. The sausage was for sure a frozen sausage patty warmed up and the \""Hollandaise\"" sauce had no flavor at all. Also, we were seated by one girl.. Another one took our drink and food order. She never came back to the table. Then, another waiter walked by and asked if we were good... We were but needed a check. So, he went and told our server who brought our check..and never came back. Luckily, we paid with cash and just left.",586984
1,"\""Boo chon to the couchon\""\n\nGood but not amazing. I hate to air some French Laundry here, but to be honest I was not impressed with Mr. Keller's extension into Vegas. I  am worshipper of all thing Keller, but maybe that hype over played what we ate. The ambiance is very Vegas and over the top. But I never go to a place for the ambiance alone. I go there because I am hungry and my taste buds tell me so. Taste buds say - salty with a chance of mediocrity. It was a good steak, and the fries were a highlight and if I could combine Bouchon fries with a double In-and-Out burger, I would call it a day and save the calories on all of the other \""French\"" delectables. But, the food overall was so salty that I felt like a camel that has been wandering the Sahara for months. The veal appetizer with the lentils were amazing! Pate? Salt lick wrapped in bacon and more salt liverishness. The oysters seemed fresh, but maybe the thought of being in the desert and having witnessed first hand what Seattle has to offer, I would save the airline fare and just fly to Seattle and find a place having happy hour by the piers. \n\nSorry, Bouchon is good, but for the amount we spent and the hype. Epic fail.",173305
3,"When in-town for for a short while, I quickly pulled up Room 112, trusting the local Yelpers hoping that I could get some good sushi on the fly. I wasn't let down and had a good time. \n\n- Average wait time\n- Free valet in the front\n- Located within a hotel\n- Prices are reasonable\n\nThe place was a bit hard to find at first since it's within a hotel and I'm not from the area. It took a while to get seated and service was slow but I arrived last minute during prime-time to grab a bite so it was expected. I left with a $50 bill for two people and for the quality was on-point.\n\nAll-in-all I chowed down on five rolls and an order of Sashimi. There were some high and low points with the meal but overall the quality was much higher than I've experienced in the South with Sushi. My wife always plays it safe and her food turned out better because it was more basic so beware. If you like to experiment with new food like I do, you might get something that is lacking.Fancy doesn't mean better.\n\nI ordered a King tuna ($9.95) and Rainbow roll ($8.95) to start. You can;t really go wrong with either because of the amount of fish that's slammed together. The King Tuna had a dabble of sauce on top which was supposed to be all of the flavor you get, but really didn't do much to add to the roll but serve as eye candy.\n\nI followed up with some Smoked salmon sashimi ($4.25) and a Shrimp hand roll ($4.95) which is always a winner as long as the fish is fresh. I would have liked to order some more sashimi since this was so delicious. Fresh salmon just melts on your tongue like butter!\n\nMy wife went for the Crunchy Cali roll ($7.95) and Super Crunchy Roll ($9.95) which are common staples in the American sushi restaurant. There is not much to say here other than you're playing it safe and don't expect and explosion of flavor.\n\nWhen eating at Room 112 you're getting the typical restaurant-in-a-hotel prices in a nice setting with reasonable food and service. If you live in the city or are just dropping by this place is worth a try.",405415
1,"If it was possible to give negative stars this place would definitely be in that category.  This place has gone so far downhill in every category over the past few years it makes me wonder why anyone would stay, play or party here.  Customer service is basically non existent.  Nightlife is horrible.  Daylife, pool parties are a joke.  Ever since that stupid show aired the pool parties are the most least desirable in Vegas.  The rooms are garbage.  AC is horrible.  The drinks are overpriced and so is the food.  If you are planning to stay in Vegas I would highly recommend staying somewhere else.",595362
3,Nothing special. Seems to me this place is popular bc its something diferent in charlotte. I eat a lot of thai and this was not that great.  I had the curry.  The curry had taste but nothing special and the cashews seemed stale.  I wouldnt go back. I make it better at home.,381570
1,"You are probably wondering how I could go from a 5 star rating to a 1 right???\n\nLet me tell you this visit the night before valentines day  is one that definitely will NOT be forgotten and the one place that we thought we had found a hidden gem with amazing deals and awesome happy hour specials has completely diminished into a place we will NEVER go back too.  I cannot tell you how long my boyfriend moaned and complained about how pissed off he was about the service and how they over charged us for things that we never received/ordered.  I understand these people wanted to go home but this was a decent size table making at least $400 in food and drink orders so we were kind of hoping that our service would be at least average, but since gratuity was already added she probably didn't give a rats A** about how well of a job she was doing to say the least.\n\nWith that being said we hoped that something to be on point with service like drinks when we asked for them and not having to ask if we would be receiving them at some point. We also ordered saki bombs and the girl brought out the wrong shot glasses and my boyfriend likes to drop in his bomb doing it the way its supposed to be done.  With the wrong glass and shot glass the beer cup chipped. Not our fault the owner hired a dim wit of a waitress who doesn't pay attention to what people ordered the other girl had to explain what we ordered and how we wanted it(when she wasn't there to take the order to begin with)and it was not that difficult if you take the time to write it down correctly it would make perfect sense.\n\nWhen we tried to explain to the girl that brought out our sushi that we did not get what we asked for and did not want what they brought us the guy behind the sushi bar was yelling in japanese like it was our fault they cannot understand a simple order.\nI hope to god that is not the owner because if it was their business will run itself into a hole real fast.  When I come to think of it every time we have gone the service has never ever been stellar. Maybe average-mediocre at most but well? Never. Since we sat inside for once we thought it might have been even better. Boy was i wrong!! absolutely horrible.  The girls were nice but just insanely stupid....to put it as nice as possible.   \n\n400 dollar table= we expected a mediocre night as far as service and not be completely over charged. 2 people that ordered 4 saki bombs usually is 15 dollars tops(because of the \""amazing\"" happy hour deals. Yesterday was $28. we ordered 3 different sushi plates...so the most it should have been would be 40-50 with tip not 75! NEVER AGAIN RUINED MY DAMN VALENTINES DAY! UGH!!@!! \n\nI hope the owner reads this and hires people who know how to take an order correctly and don't have argumentative sushi chefs.  \n\nWORST NIGHT EVER....I will miss the jalapeno monkey balls but i will not miss the Horrrrrid service. So definitely the worst spot you can go to with more than a couple friends.",390639
2,"This is a small local place has seating for about 38. They have a great selection of beer. They also have two smaller tvs (32\"") and one larger tv (50\""). \n\nI will reiterate that the beer selection is more than reasonable, but that's the only positive I can think of. My wife ordered a mixed drink with a wedge of lime. The lime was brown and smelled horrible. \n\nThe cheese curds were not bad, but they weren't memorable at all. The are lightly battered and served hot with a side of ranch. They are a bit greasy, but again not bad just not good either.  They left me saying, \""meh\"".  \n\nI ordered a chicken sandwich with fries. The chicken appeared to be precooked and frozen and was simply warmed back up. It was served on a kaiser bun, which did have nice flavor. The wilted lettuce took away from it completely though. The plain mayonnaise was needed but it's complete lack of flavor just took away from this already below average sandwich. The French fries were definitely frozen and then deep fried. Another instance of they weren't bad but they weren't good.\n\n\nI don't like giving out poor reviews, but I think people also need to know what to expect. Come here if you want to get a beer and well that's about it.",416244
4,"Hamachi Sashimi - Perfect. Tender. Fresh.\n\nUni Sushi - Very fresh. Not too slimy. Melts in your mouth.\n\nAsakusa Rolls - Spicy tina topped with albacore and scallions, tataki sauce on top - The spice level was good but it was missing that extra kick. The tuna was good..The roll just didn't have anything that stood out.\n\nOsaka Rice - mixture of sushi rice, crab, masago, mayo, sesame oil, and sriracha - Sooooo much yumminess. It's like a comfort food more than anything else. Def try this.\n\nI think it's best to stick with with the fresh sashimi and get some osaka rice to have a good meal.",65211
5,I love this place!\n\nI grew up in southern California and I think I know a little something about mexican food.  This place rocks!  The food is inexpensive and they give you huge portions.  The chips are always fresh and the salsa is great.  The burritoes are big and tasty.  I wish I could live in San Diego and eat here every day.  I lived in Henderson for 8 months and I was a regular here.  This is a must stop in for me every time I visit Vegas.\n\nYummmy,69740
4,"We got there early, 6:30 on a balmy Vegas evening, and lucked out with a table on the terrace, with only a glass partition between us and the stunning \""Lake of Dreams,\"" featuring a breathtaking waterfall. Service was lovely and plentiful, maybe a tad too much. I mean, seriously, with the bustling of the maitre d, sommelier, waiter, server, and then the bread and Pellegrino guy, I barely had a chance to grope my guy under the table!\n\nAfter a couple of cocktails to kick off our hour of livin' large, we ordered the second cheapest bottle of wine ($45) on the huge and jaw-dropping high-priced list: 2005 Bear & Lion Old Vine Zinfandel. That ole grape juice was not too shabby, and while I'm no sommelier (though I've ingested many boxes of vino in my day), I thought it paired nicely with our starter, which was the chicken liver mousse. I know, I know, liver--blech--certainly doesn't sound \""to die for,\"" but that 20-year bourbon bone marrow mash literally melted in our mouths. It was the best part of the meal, actually.\n\nWe also had the glazed duck, which was kind of dry and tasted so-so, and the Original NY DB Burger. Yes, I was the dork who ordered a $32 hamburger. But it wasn't just any burger, it was sirloin stuffed with braised short ribs, foie gras and black truffle! I'd have liked a bolder truffle flavor, but it was delicious anyway--or at least, I thought so; my old man was underwhelmed. In any case, we were too full and too buzzed to have dessert, but not too buzzed to not notice a giant golden head slowly emerge from the water in front of the majestic waterfall/fountain and then disappear again--that really happened! Oh, and the women's bathroom is gorgeous.",190665
4,"This was my second time here. They have a decent variety of flavors so you can usually find one you like. I was surprised to see some made with stevia, but they were just too sweet. I ended up getting the cotton candy flavor. It was good.\n\nYes they have sample cups so you can try different flavors before you make your final\nChoices \n\nI would have given 5 stars for more options of yogurt flavors",392751
1,"If I could choose no stars for this place I would. The only thing that was decent was the waitress. She was super sweet. \nFirst, I have never had fish and chips that was not edible. Until now that is. The grease was literally pooled on my plate. Even after soaking it up with a napkin it was swimming. I cut into it and the fish wasn't even cooked. Gross\nMy friend ordered the pot roast. One bite and she was done. I think her words were something akin to \""dog food.\"" \nIf this wasn't bad enough, we actually got charged for this crap. Don't waste your time with this place. I certainly won't.",55665
5,"Yum yum yum! I love this place's breakfast burrito and their carne asada. For some reason, the first time I went to the 7th ST location, i didn't like it. However, I came back after about 6 months and now I am addicted!\n\nI do prefer this location over the 7th street for some reason. This location seems to have a nicer staff. Plus it's close to some really awesome antique shops! Makes for a great pre-antiquing breakfast!",428209
3,"I didn't really like this one. We have been to lots of shows in Las Vegas, but this one was my least favorite. The theatre was really awesome, but the show was not that good. Probably worth going to if you can't find tickets to other shows.",182325
3,"Our Sunday ritual is pizza for lunch, so we decided to try this place we saw on Yelp. We live 15 miles away, but the reviews made it sound like it was worth the trip.\n\nFrom the outside it is your classic hole in the wall place, in a main shopping center, with the front windows painted. The front had a mural of New York and the detail was pretty good, something I've never seen before.\n\nWe walk inside and it's a little dark, the menu board is clearly outdated with the numbers and letters tacked to a blackboard. There's an employee sitting at the table folding boxes right in the front, I found this kind of odd, couldn't he do it in the back? And as I walked around there's a ton of space in the back of the dining area that he could be folding boxes... He shouldn't have been in the front where the customers walk in the door.\n\nWe place our order but the front counter guy tells us to wait a minute while he answers the telephone. He should have taken our order first and put the call on hold as we were the only people in line.\n\nWe sat at nice clean booth and a few minutes later our garlic knots arrived. They were nice and hot and they even split them into two baskets for the Mrs. And I. (That way I couldn't steal her extra ones).\n\nAbout 30 minutes later hot pizza was delivered to our table. It was O.K. It was pretty greasy and the crust reminded me of Peter Piper Pizza. Not the best, not the worst, certainly not worth $25. \n\nThe bathrooms were pretty clean, however the entire place smelled like sanitizer.\n\nI'd probably come back, if I was in the area, and only for a slice and a drink, but we won't be making the 20 minute drive for it.\n\nNot sure why there are so many 5 star reviews, either people don't know there are many other better places for pizza, or maybe the owners have a lot of \""goombas\"" on the payroll to make the place look good.",361507
1,"Very unhappy with their services. They gave us a rental with paint on the passenger's seat. My dress got ruined and  I had to drive with a towel draped over the seat the whole 10 days we had the car. When I called the customer care number, they were very unhelpful and did not want to help in any way. Never renting from them again and will spread the word about their unprofessional services. Unhappy customer. They don't even deserve one star.",410626
2,"So sad such a beautiful property doesn't have a good staff to match. \n\nI visited a chairman level member friend of mine (their term for high level players) for a day at the pool and was very disappointed. The staff was impeccably rude upon my arrival, and cocktail service was terrible. As soon as I sat, a cocktail dropped by not to offer her services but to let us know she was leaving bc it was slow. I waited another 30 min with no sign of the other cocktail she spoke of that would be \""checking on us\"". After going to the bar myself to order a round for my friends and I, I was not offered a receipt. Normally, I wouldn't mind, however, I was then informed by my friend who has been gambling there a very long time, they add an 18% gratuity to every bill (calling it a pool/resort fee) that goes directly to their employees and do not bother to tell you. Which is probably why I wasn't offered a receipt- so I would be unaware I was double tipping. By the end of my three hr afternoon a cocktail waitress had dropped by once right after I had returned from the bar. My other friends each took a turn going to the bar themselves afterward and the pool deck wasn't even busy. I will not be returning to this beautiful property ever again to spend a dime.",183254
3,"The problem that we had was with the service.  When we arrived, the first person we encountered was our server,who had a look of confusion when we 1st interacted with her, and her deer-in-the-headlights expression started to complement her performance as a server.  When we 1st arrived, we tell her that we are 2 and a baby... she glances around at some free tables and tells me that we need to wait.  We stand there for some time until the manager approaches us with a bit of a surprised look on his face and quickly sits us at one of the vacant tables that the girl glanced at.  I ask our server for a high chair for my son... I stand there for like 5 minutes until the manager approaches me and gets me one.  Our food took long, the server never came to check on us, we never got any drinks refilled, and I had to hunt down the server for our check.  \n\nI want to make it clear that this place is not good to take kids to.  My son is actually great in restaurants.  My son doesn't throw tantrums, throw food, or run around.  He sits in his high chair, makes some noise (nothing crazy), and eats.  Granted, there's gonna be some food on the floor, but that's the worst of it.  When the server saw the food on the floor... deer-in-headlights.  There was honestly about 1/2 cup of scattered noodles / rice on the floor.  She responded as though I took everything we ordered and threw it all over the restaurant!\n\nDon't get me wrong... the food here is excellent!  We saw many Japanese couples around the restaurant eating, which was a huge sign to my wife and I that this place would most likely be authentic.  The quality and freshness of the food proved to be outstanding.  My wife and I are from San Francisco and were used to frequenting Japan-town for authentic Japanese food and this place seemed  as authentic as what we are used to.\n\nQuick conclusion: bad service, don't bring young children, authentic delicious Japanese food",63284
1,"we went to Las Vegas for Thanksgiving. It is the true Mecca for foodies. Having been a fan of his many cooking reality shows we decided to eat at the grill at Cesars Palace.Things quickly went down hill after being seated in a tiny table stuck next to a row of 4 cramped tables with barely breathing room. Our waiter was the worst I have ever encountered after eating out for 30 years at some of the better to best restaurants in the US and Europe. He repeatedly ignored us and after sitting for 30 minutes without a drink I complained to the management who got us started with our cocktails. This caused our waiter to futher act out in a blatant passive aggressive way. He did not smile, gave us no eye contact but plenty of attitude as he sarcastically announced with each entree \""is this good enough for you\"". I literally wanted to put the food up his U KNOW WHAT but we were hungry and would have been late for our show so we had to put up wth this clown. While ordering, they had 'RUN OUT \"" of 3 of the 4 items????. Sounded odd. Anyway the shepards pie was ok, the lobster mac and cheese very salty and my memory is a wash with the rest of the meal. Thus I conclude that it must not have been memorable. I was so irritated with this snarky, pompous jack ass of a waiter it was all I could do to contain myself.\nThe one plus was dessert some kind of bread pudding that was super sweet but definitely the best among the items ordered . Just when I thought things were bad enough I went into the rest room. Had I done that first thing, I would NEVER have eaten at this establishment. It was FILTHY. Yes! you may find it hard to believe, I DID but the smell and look of the toilet was as if they had not cleaned it. Rather disgusting what was on the toilet seat thus I will NOT describe it in case you are as visual as I am. I still can't get the imagery out of my mind a month later. When it came to soap supplies, they had 1 little bottle of soap for 4 sinks and plenty of patrons waiting like kindergardeners to get a squirt of the stuff. A 50 plus year old to my left erupted and questioned the staff and was seen on my way out complaining to upper management. Tell you what, for such a fussy chef with his noteriety of perfectionistic standards, he should visit the place he sold his name to on the sly and see for himself. A real let down and all around dive with absolutely lazy staff that needs a major attitude over haul. I would never recommend this place.",584059
2,Food is great but tue service was not. No one taking orders for almost 5 minutes and a huge line developed. When they finally came back only ONE person took orders. Long wait for food.,575714
1,"I have been going to Sammy's for a little less than a year after finding it on restaurant.com.  I liked it enough to purchase additional coupons for it, but I would only go once a month or once every 2 - 3 months.  I live on the West side of town and this is on the East side of town so it wasn't all that convenient..\n\nI had gone the other day after picking up a friend from the airport and when I presented my coupon I was told that as of November 1st, he, the owner was no longer going to accept the coupons.  I said I had more coupons at home.  He said I should bring in what I had and start using them before Nov 1st.   I had 5 more coupons.  \n\nThe next day I called him to verify the use of the coupons.  I also asked him, since he wasn't going to be accepting them anymore can I use more than 1 since there was going to be 4 of us going there the next day.  He said, \""one coupon per email per day\"".  I said fine.  \n\nNext day rolls around and I bring in 3 friends, he said I wasn't going to be allowed to use them.   He said the rules state 1 coupon per month.  I said but you told me the other day, PLUS I called yesterday.  All he could do was repeat the rules of restaurant.com of one a month.  He said he loses money every time the coupons is used.  After he and I both were repeating each other in frustration, I finally got him to admit, \""well, I changed my mind\"".\n\nAt that point, my friends who I had also just picked up from the airport started to chime in to tell the owner off.  I was quite embarrassed that this was happening in front of my out of town guests.

I will never be going back there again so his statement can hold true...he will lose money.\n\nI would have been perfectly all right if he did not say to me to bring the rest of the coupons in or to tell me when I called that I wouldn't be able to use them.

3,"This place is really convient and cool.  We were really excited that something was moving in right down the block.  The pizza was great and the sub hit the spot.  My only issue was the price.  2 dollars per topping seems a little steep.

My friend had one of the Omelets which gave me a slight case of food envy, but I had seen the manhattan burg in a old weekly and had already made up my mind to try it and I was not disappointed",369592
4,"My family and I dined here for tapas. At first we were worried that the kids might not have anything to eat here. But everybody loved what they ordered. Price is reasonable. We would come here again next time we're in Vegas. If you have to order Paella, order it ahead of time while waiting for your table since it takes about 30 min to prepare. It will cut down on your waiting time.. Paella is good for 2 people if that's the only thing you're ordering but if you have tapas on the side, 3-4 people can actually share it.. Great service too.",417302

4,"This is a nice place to grab a quick & healthy bite or drink after your workout at Warrior Fitness Center.  It's one of the healthier choices on base.  It rarely gets too busy, so the seemingly small cafe has ample room to sit & eat.  Prices are reasonable, and the menu is small but adequate.  They'd probably make more money by selling individual-sized servings of nutritional supplements instead of the whole container (catering to infrequent users, more budget-minded exercisers and people who just forgot to bring or take their nutrients before coming to the gym).  The staff is friendly and helpful; I haven't had a bad experience yet.

It's geared to the more misunderstood teenagers, although you can pick up one or two things for a fancy dress. In fairness, they are dressing up as well.

2,"ANOTHER BIG TIME FAIL FROM MY YELP COMMUNITY!!\n\nCraving some serious breakfast after a long night of partying. I had already bookmarked this restaurant prior to my Las Vegas Trip based on the stellar reviews. We ventured away from the strip to this restaurant located in an industrial area inside a small strip mall don't flinch you might miss it. \n\nMy wife and I arrived at 1pm., placed our name on the wait list, Very friendly gentlemen greets us and tells us there is a 25min. wait. I says no problem. We were seated within the time frame, our waitress takes our order right away as we were starving. I usually stop at Starbucks to get a coffee when eating at most breakfast spots as the coffee tends to be weak but I overlooked my instincts lazily and decided to try theirs. Well unsurprisingly the Coffee was super weak. As soon as I added creamer it turned milky instantly. My Bad $2.50.\n\nFood/Prices- I opted for the DENVER OMELETTE with home fries and Toast Price was decent under $9. I asked the waitress if I can sub bacon for the ham that comes with the denver she said no problem.  Our order took a little while to come out. The presentation looked great big portion for sure; better than it tasted. My OMELETTE- TOTAL grease pit, they used tons of oil to cook it, plus the cheese stuffed inside was your poor quality cheese used at most LA style burger joints that increased the greasiness further. First couple bites were very mushy eggs were not cooked that well, upon further inspection I also noticed very little bacon in my omelette so I began to open it up and noticed they didnt even cook the bacon at all prior to stuffing it in my omelette. The potatoes were the only thing that came out good they were hot and crispy. I couldnt finish it even though I was starving i did enjoy the potatoes but was very dissapointed. \n\nMy wife ordered the French toast special, served with Eggs and Bacons under $9. Her eggs also cooked with tons of oil, bacon was good. The French toast that everyone raves about was weak yo. First of all it was served cold, next it had no flavor you couldnt add enough syrup to give it flavor. No moistness, no tastes of eggs or cinnamon ever touching the bread. Maybe they dipped the texas toast in milk and pan fried not sure. Was a total fail. \n\nWaitress came by asked us how our food was, I told her I was disappointed with the french toast coming out so cold. She opted to warm it up for us but by this time I was completely disillusioned with my meal. I decided to pay, leave and will not come back. \n\nPrices are Good; Portions are Big, Service Is Good, However, I prefer quality over quantity food was not on point. Sorry Yelpers this was a fail dont do it! Should have tried the breakfast spot at my hotel not worth the hassle of leaving the Strip.",369725
5,"I recently got married on 05/04/2013. I had planned my wedding for a little over a year and felt very \""ahead of the game,\"" and organized. I had picked out everything, lined up all of the vendors and was sure that I was prepared and ready to go. Then out of no where 30 days before the wedding chaos set in! I realized about five weeks out that I was not where I needed to be and that with work, it was extremely difficult to finish all of the final details. The last thirty days truly are what make the wedding or event what they are. I began research for a wedding planner. My fianc\u00e9 was very much against the idea. He felt that all of our family members, grandparents and aunts would be perfect for the task of setting up and breaking down the wedding. Thank God I found Sip and Twirl. I contacted Laurie explaining that I needed some serious help! \n\nWho was going to handle the vendors day of, who was going to set up all of our favors and goodies, and decor, who was going to get us in line and ready for the rehearsal... who collects the gifts and sentimental artifacts at the end? \n\nWithin minutes of emailing Laurie I got all the reassurance I needed. She responded and was so kind and very clear about how they could help me. She asked me to give her all information in regards to the wedding... so I slowly gathered my huge list and handed it all over to her. She was so sincere, professional and easy to talk with.\n\n I then was introduced to Caily who became my go to girl! She is AMAZING! I met with her and Laurie to discuss final details and without a hitch I gave them complete control of everything! That was the best moment of my entire wedding planning! Caily eased all of my concerns, confirmed all of my vendor information two days prior, and made certain modifications of things I didn't even think of! \n\nCaily is so sweet  and willing to help with anything AT ALL! She truly made my day magical!  All of the loose ends and details I hadn't even thought of came together like a dream.. and it is only because of her! \n\nThese ladies are beyond good at what they do, they have an eye for events! I truly for the first time in the planning experience had nothing to think about. The rehearsal went so smooth and our families were given great instruction on where to be and when (which was SO needed). The day of, I got to relax and forget about the details. When I arrived at the venue I was blown away with how beautiful everything looked, and how smooth everything was going. We received countless praises from all of our guests about what an amazing night they had! That is the best complement to any bride and groom! \n\nI could ramble on for days to tell you what a duo these two are... but you need to see for yourself. They are affordable, reliable, hard working and AMAZING! We have amazing memories from this day and none of it would have been possible without Laurie and Caily! \n\nI am going to miss them!! \n\nMolly!",601781

3,"It's about time I found a truly good indian restaurant in Las Vegas. The chicken tikka masala was delicious when paired with their perfectly cooked garlic naan. Slightly crispy as well as soft and chewy. Tried the goat curry which was nice and earthy. My date thought some parts of the meat were too tendony but I surmised that it's because when cooking such an unusual meat, they probably used most parts of the animal. \n\nMy only true complaint was that our waiter pretty much forgot to take our order and no one else came by our table in a long time. There were only 3 other tables being served at the time! We didn't get to eat til about 40 minutes from the time we sat down. I'm willing to forgive this hopefully one-time incident because of the surprisingly good food. I was treated to a spectacle of the family-sized dosa being served at the next table. It was huge! Can't wait to come back and try it.",566262
2,"This was the 3rd salon I tried out in Vegas after Diva's Studio and Limelight Salon. I came in for a a cut only. The stylist I had was real nice, and at that time had 2 years experience for hair. I asked for a bob cut. I liked she used scissors to cut my thick asian hair. My hair was shorter than I wanted and I wasn't too impressed by how the bob turned out. I wasn't too thrilled I spent $55 for it either. \n\nI guess it's worth trying if my friends in the hospitality industry and at my government job were getting nice cuts here...Just not for me.",60379
5,"These are the best, most consistent donuts in the valley.  I was always a fan of the Chandler location, so I tried this location as soon as it opened.  I was pleased that the donuts were as fresh and as varied as the other location.\n\nI don't care if people go to dunkin for the coffee..a donut shop is about the donuts, and I haven't yet had any donuts in the valley in the same league as BoSa.",451939
