1,"Just to let you know, the owner of the restaurant contacted me after she read my review and told me I complain too much.",459224
5,"We came to this tapas and wine bar after having visited there on the Tour de Food Uptown.  We shared rabbit pot pie that was succulent and flavorful.  There was a sweetness to the dish that was intriguing.  The vegetables retained some texture and added a pleasing crunch.  Our next dish was lamb bahn mi sliders.  These were outstanding on crisp toasted bread, soft on the inside.  Flavorful toppings made it very tasty. The crab cakes allowed the crab to be the star, but added enough garnish to make it unique.  Finally we shared the red neck wedding cake which was outstanding.  The spicy nuts made the dish very interesting instead of just a good chocolate care with cheerwine(!) icing.  They are not afraid to go bold in this restaurant and it succeeds.  I hope they get more business so that they stay around!",425079
3,"My 8 yr old daughter really wanted to eat at Rainforest after passing by it dozens of times during our many trips to Vegas. We were seated right away but it took 10 minutes for our waiter to notice we were there. He was very nice. Lance, I think. \n\nThe prices are pretty high. Kids meals are $10 each. Yikes. My daughter ordered popcorn shrimp and fries that were pretty decent. I ordered the quesadilla appetizer (because I refuse to pay $16 to $19 for pasta or a burger). It was pretty good but I would have liked the salsa or part of it to be a little spicier. \n\nOh, and another LV restaurant with $4 sodas.  Also, my feet literally stuck to the floor under my table. Yuck. My daughter really enjoyed looking around at all the animals and thought the thunderstorm was pretty cool. \n\nOverall, not a bad experience. I don't think I'll go back, but I won't totally count it out.",137462
4,"Despite the location in south Scottsdale, Avalon is just a really classy place that has a lot to offer. The dining experience is fabulous. The food is delicious. The atmosphere is top-notch. The music is transcendent - very hypnotic. The vibe is cool. The decor is first-class, upscale NY/LAish. The service is more than decent. They have brunch on weekends, live music and cooking classes. I highly recommend Avalon. It is worth checking out. Say hello to Dominick. Thinking about a company party or group celebration. This is the spot.",366749
4,"So I work as a merchandiser and  I dislike WalMart from a consumer point of view. Of course the karma Gods of merchandising assigned me to a WalMart account (not this one, another one). I only buy something at WalMart because I was already there servicing my account but I'm not one to plan to come to shop for groceries or household needs unless it's late at night since that's all there is. \n\nWhy am I giving 4 stars to a place that I generally dislike? \n\nThis store is the only WalMart to have random clearance blowouts for $1 for their clothing items.  This is the account my mother in law is assigned to and she happened to be there finishing up her account when she saw them wheel out the racks. She got 8 items for me for $8. I have to admit that the dresses are actually pretty cute! They have OP clothing which is just comfortable beachy wear and grabbed me 4 of their summer dresses. She got these tanks that are pretty decent and  I can be happy to have tanks I can use for my dirty work and not ruin nicer  outfit worthy ones.Really for $1 and it being Wal Mart I was expecting it to be a hodge podge of their leftover, terrible design ideas- old lady designs. OP, Susie Rose, Miley/Max Azria stuff isn't bad. I wouldn't go out of my way to shop these brands, but for hella clearance, hey, I'll take a look. \n\nSo there a little WalMart secret- this is the only one that announces out the $1. Some of the others mark them down at the register but dont announce it. Some don't do it at all. It's kinda at random though, I don't think there's a scheduled time and date it happens except it seems like it's on Fridays. \n\nAdded a pic of one of the $1 dresses.",472293
1,"We went today, June 22, 2014 which is a Sunday at 1:00pm. We expected it to be busy at this time on a Sunday but it was pretty bare. \n\nThe hostesses didn't seem to know what they were doing. One of them sat my family (my husband and our 4 year old son) at a table and then we never heard from anybody again. 15 minutes and not one person came to our table despite a couple (literally only two) servers looking our way and then walking away. We decided it wasn't worth it anymore and left. On our way out, we saw the manager up front with the hostesses and he didn't seem like he was doing much. Funny that he was up front with nobody to seat and not walking around in an almost empty restaurant to make sure that the tables that were there were being taken care of. \n\nThe hostesses and the manager said, \""Thanks for coming in!\"" without looking up at as. I glanced at all of them with a confused look and finally the girl that sat us looked right at me with an expression that said, \""Wait. I sat them just 15 minutes ago...???\""  \n\nThey need to get a better system going. Maybe have the hostess TELL the servers that they have people seated. Or maybe have the manager manage it all. Either way, I don't know what the food tastes like because we never got there.",316770
5,"Got my car wash there today. I've been going for three years now at least once every week, fantastic, best place in town bar none to get your car wash, I strongly recommend",465000
2,"Not sure why everyone is crazy about this place. chicken fingers tasted ordinary for me, sauce is forgettable, fries are soggy, and coleslaw is like the one in the supermarket. the only one i liked is the toasted bread. \nThough the store and location is great and neat.",449990
4,"**UPDATE**\n\nOkay, after staying at the Alladin/ Planet Hollywood I am going to beg Ballys to take us back!!!  I went back there my last day and everything was sunshine compared to the OTHER hotel. I will just have to be super sweet and bat my eyelashes and wink at the receptionist (whether guy or girl) and beg for the newer cleaner rooms next time we are there. My guy and I figured that the people at the OTHER HOTEL are so rude and arent ready to jump to keep you happy because they arent UNIONIZED. I am giving this hotel an upgrade to 4 stars. LUV YA BALLYS!!!! PS... They do have comfortable beds & room service is also good. \n\n\nThis is one of the worst hotels. If you are the new side the rooms are a bit better. But still not up to par. We go there at least 3 times a year because of business and it sucks that the organization can only use this place. Most of the time the check in people are rude.",451311
3,"Houston's has great food, generous drinks (glass wine list need desperate help though), and stuck up waiters.  It is that simple. \nFrench Dip   =5 stars\nSpinach dip = 5 stars \nRibs             =5 stars\nSea bass      =5 stars\nService         =2 stars. Would it kill them to smile?\n\nGet over yourselfs and be nice.  I bet I have eaten at this location at least a dozen times this year and I can't remember any server saying a simple Thank You for dinning with us from any of my servers.  \n\nAnd it is just this location... Coral Gables, Aventura, Palm Beach, 23rd & 5th in NYC, Hackensack ... All offer great service so let's get it together Scottsdale!!!",42519
2,"My friend and I went to Postrio on a recent trip to Vegas.  She had been there several times before - all good experiences.  After our evening there, I would never go back.  We were seated promptly (we had a reservation), but no one came to our table for 15 minutes.  Not to bring water or to tell us they'd be right with us.  Finally, our server came to the table and we were able to order wine.  10 minutes later, our wine arrived.  The server sat it on the table and said \""I'll be right back to pour it\"" and went on to take drinks and checks to other tables.  The food was mediocre at best.  I had herb gnocchi with wild mushrooms, a caesar salad, and peach gallette for dessert.  My friend did seem to love her classic lasagna.  The food wasn't horrible... just nothing special.  I've eaten better at popular chain restaurants and expected more from a Wolfgang Puck gig.  Oh - and, we were seated out in the mall part of the restaurant, which completely killed the ambiance I would like when paying Postrio prices.",136213
4,"Oh .... my.....God!  5 R Cha  Thai Bistro is a wonderful alternative to Mexican food in the Mesa area.  I loved everything about this place: (1) the food: (2) the staff: (3) the ambiance: (4) the parking; (5) the location: and (6) the incredible warm and welcoming service.  The menu has a great selection of dishes.  There is the typical curry, but there is the crispy, fresh Green Papaya Salad.  The Penang Curry is rich, and the spice level of this dish is your choice.  The delicious Green Tea ice cream with Roti is also great.  I think some of these dishes have a Malay/Thai fusion and that is a great idea.  I love this place!!!!",528351
4,"It's the bees knee's man! \n\nWe ducked into this spot on a rainy day for lunch and I'm so glad we did. My husband and I were sat right in front of the window and watch the cars splash by. I was going to order a Red Stripe (yes! they have Red Stripe) and the bartender suggested Longboard which they have on tap. This malty beer was a joy to drink, so refreshing, it hit the spot. For lunch I had the Hula's Island Cobb, very delicious. I was skeptical about the spam but it ended up being a great substitute for bacon. My only gripe is the chicken was described as \""marinated\"" on the menu which sold me on the salad but when I had it the meat was plain. My hubs had the Luau Pork Sandwich and it's truly heaven on a bun, served with yummy sweet potato fries. Both meals were large portions and we finished every bite. \n\nWe had a really good time at Hula's, great service, delish food & beer. We will be going back fo sho! Oh, and I should also mention that the silverware is now wrapped in cloth napkins. If I would have read these reviews before my visit Amy's \""fork door holder\"" story would have kept me away.",406215
2,"As far as the grocery section of this store is concerned,  it is pretty nice - seems like they might be having trouble adapting to a Kroger plan-o-gram, as items are hard to find and their placement in the store doesn't always make sense.  The staff is as courteous as any I've encountered since moving here. \nNow -about the pharmacy - totally different attitudes and staff doesn't seem aware of what they are doing.  I had my prescriptions transferred from Kroger in Ohio - they were good until February 2015.  Three of them Fry's refilled and noted \""no refills\"" on the bottles; even though my doctor had approved.  They did not have one of my medications and said they had to order it.  That was okay with me.  This was on a Tuesday and I was told the medication would be available on Friday.  I went back on Friday and the pharmacy worker told me that the order had come in but hadn't been unpacked yet.  At no time did he offer to go and get it for me.  I asked him what the cost was going to be (since I have new insurance) and he said, \""$25.00\"".  On Saturday I went back to get it; and the woman pharmacy manager told me a price that was almost 10 times the one I was quoted the day before.  I pointed at the young man who had given me that price, and she said, \""How would he know?\""  I pointed out to her that he was looking in the same computer she was.  She turned to him and he looked at me and said he had never told me that...now, come  on, folks, I didn't pull that price out of thin air.\n\nTo make a long story short, Walgreen's now has a new customer.  Go for groceries but steer clear of the pharmacy if you can...I would have been a bit appeased if someone had apologized and said it was an error - but I was offered no explanation or apology...guess the customer doesn't matter to the pharmacy techs.",474538
3,"Cheap, smokey, loud.\n\nGood beer selection, a few pool tables, and tons of TVs.\n\nThe young college crowd likes to get wasted here.\n\nIt can be a fun place.",521889
4,"This is a solid location.  Restaurant was clean, service was good, and the sandwich was tasty.",43236
3,"I came here around 3 or 4am (don't remember) so my review might not be the best, but I'll give it a shot. It was pretty empty when we came and the had a limited menu in the middle of the night. \n\nI ordered the filet medalions, potatoes, and scrambled eggs w/ cheese. My friend had eggs with sausage. Everything was good except the filet. It came with two small pieces that were really dry and flavorless. It was still edible at 3am. \n\nI remember our waitress being nice. If you're in the Harrah's late at night this place is ok. I wouldn't come here during the morning for breakfast and wait in line.",307442
1,"I'm not sure why people review this place so highly. Maybe it's conveniently located to them? Otherwise, the food is poor quality and very....VERY much overpriced. Selection is scarce. Service is AWFUL. Walk a few blocks and take in one of the many gems of the Strip. But this is not one.",424342
2,"The map picture for this one is incorrect.  This location is actually at Alma School and Germann, in the Fry's plaza.  I'll give a place 3 strikes before I say something heavily negative, and this is it for this joint.  One employee, Jim, has ruined it for me.  I don't know if he's just an old school chauvinist, or if he's deeply insecure and mean-spirited, but he's waited on me 3 times.  Every time condescending and rude.  And the last time I was so irritated, I just wanted to get out of there and when I got to the car I realized he didn't give me my change.  It was only a nickel, so no big deal.  I hope he can use that towards a customer service class.  \n\nIf he's not there, it's fine and I like all the services that The UPS Store offers.  I used to travel all over the country for a company who has a corporate account with them and I would always get A+ service no matter where I went.  In the future I will use a different location.",41666
4,"When you want something quick on this side of town, Chinese, and reasonable, this is the place to go- been going to this one for years. I usually get the bowl with half white rice and half vegetables, with either the beef and broccoli or the mushroom chicken. I don't finish it, I save half for later. My husband gets the two item with half fried rice, half chow mein- beef & broccoli and orange chicken. Sometimes he gets the pork but only if it's lean. Sometimes, we each get an eggroll (when you complete the receipt survey within 2 days, this could be free). Fortune cookies come with your meals.\n\nUniform design for this fast food chain restaurant. Most of these restaurants are decorated the same: panda prints, red paint, tables/chairs, bar type tables/chairs. Free refills on sodas. Bathroom in one corner. Open kitchen- cut veggies in clear bins kept in the refrigerator- I love that, though sometimes the veggies are pretty chunky. Most of the food trays were full. There were three people working. This is a fairly busy but clean location that shares the parking lot with McDonald's. It wasn't as busy yesterday but then again, we got there past 1 pm though. Several strip malls in the area and close to the Boulevard Mall- convenient location.",143693
4,"Surprisingly good, as I am not a fan of Indian food. The service was good, and attentive. I asked for and received a sample tasting of the featured Masala sauce.  We both enjoyed our meals.  But they DO need to get rid of the \""guys\"" thing.",320241
5,"If you want to go to a clean place: don't come here.\nIf you mind seeing fingerprints in your bread: don't come here.\nIf you wan't an amazing sandwich filled with pittsburgh history and tastiness: come here.\nIf you want a pittsburgh experience: come here.\nIf you are watching your weight: don't come here.\n\nI love this place. Not healthy in the least, but you get awesome food with friendly people. If you are a tourist, you have to come here.",157199
2,"I wouldn't go out of my way to go here again.  The food was \""eh\"" and I noticed almost everything was served in a bowl, so for example my burger was sitting on top of my already mushy fries.  My drink order was wrong and nobody came around again to find out if everything was ok with our food/drink, so that was that.  My sister went another time with her husband and she said they messed up her meal too.  The biggest thing I noticed was that there were literally only teenagers working there, so that probably plays a big role in the lackluster service.  My office chair was filthy when I went to sit down, so I tried to switch it with the one next to it, but it was dirty too.  If it wasn't for the great movie we saw (Lawless!) then I would have really been bummed about the whole experience.  Next time I'd rather just eat somewhere that I know the food/service is good, and go see a traditional movie.",534253
3,"The donuts here were pretty good.  In the NW there are few options for donuts - so I would say this is the best place for donuts out this way.\n\nThe lady usually throws in a few extra donut holes with a dozen and once through in a few extra donuts!!! That is cool.  All the donuts were good and fresh - except the apple fritters.  Very little apple - it was mostly fritter.  Also, not a huge selection.  I didn't see any of those french crullers, no chocolate cake donuts either...\n\nI do enoy getting donuts in the old school pink box and I will return specifically for that!",439534
5,"These guys are always great. I needed some quick setting changes done on an ECM that was flashed back to stock (2011 Chevrolet Silverado 1500) so I called around and everyone else told me they're booked solid for 3 weeks out. I called dyno comp and talked to the owner, Richard, who said they're booked too but he would fit me in sometime during the day and to just call and give him a heads up the day before. When I went in, I was back on the road in under and hour with the settings changed like I needed. The work was done at a reasonable rate and I fully intend to return when I get a supercharger installed.",46552
1,"What a difference a day can make!  Yesterday my wife and her friends stopped at Yoli's for breakfast on the way to the Gem Stone Show in Tucson. When she came home and she said we have to go back, that she really had enjoyed her breakfast.  So this morning I agreed to give it a try.  I'm a big fan of locally owned joints and always try to support those verses chain restaurants.   Yoli's is off on a little side street in downtown Chandler.  It's in a converted little bungalow that features some other little shops in a common courtyard.  When we walked in, 9:30ish, there were some tables available and a waitress walked by and told us to sit wherever we wanted.  Around the same time several other couples came in and seated themselves.  Customers around us seemed to be enjoying their meals and from what I could see they looked good.  We continued to see wait staff running around but nobody was acknowledging us, they could have said' \""sorry, we'll be with you in a moment\"".  Now my wife is getting perturbed, I'm normally the one that says I'm outta here after 10 minutes but today for some reason I was being the voice of reason. Finally after 18 minutes the same waitress comes by and asked if we have looked a menu yet, we didn't have any yet, we have no beverages or silverware - nothing!  She comes back with 1 and says that they don't have any extra menus and could we share this one.  Still hasn't asked us if we would care to have anything to drink.  After she finished serving the table next to us she then asks if we would like anything to drink, finally!  She comes back with our coffee and waters and she takes our order.  When my wife inquires about the potato choice we are told that they are out of the country potatoes today.  Its mid-morning and you are running out of potatoes already?  Ok, so we get our ordered placed and start to enjoy our coffee.  In the mean time I'm noticing 2 couples sitting outside and they have been waiting at least 15 minutes and no one is acknowledging them, you can see them looking around to see if they can flag down help.  When they finally wait on them we notice that they are getting their coffee in paper cups.  Then we hear another waitress tell the four top next to us that they have run out of coffee cups and hope they don't mind the paper ones.  My wife says they never had to wait the day before, which they had great service and the food was out in descent time.  Not so today.  It's now been 40 minutes since we placed our order, the waitress comes out to the table next to use to ask who ordered the Steak & Peppers Skillet, they reply that isn't our order, the waitress turns and looks at us (mind you now, she took our order) and says I wonder who ordered this.  I said that I also ordered the Steak & Pepper Skillet and she says they wrote the wrong table number on the slip.  (It was you honey) She then hands me a menu and ask if I would like to order something else, that they are out of Carne Asada for that meal.  This tells me that the cooks aren't checking what is being ordered until they are preparing that meal or the waitress is not in tune with the kitchen.  Either way that was the final straw for me.  We left and I'm disappointed for them.  You have to take care of your customers in a timely manner.  I could have over looked running out of some of the ingredients but not 40 minutes after you have taken my order.  Someday, if you last, I will try you again.  Good luck Yoli's!",484702
1,Don't waste your time! They charge outlandish fees! They told us that if we brought our paychecks in to get verified then they could deposit it same day instead of having to wait. Guess what?!? They can't do that and you have to wait four days! I have used credit unions all over the US and never heard of anything as stupid as this credit union. We will definitely NEVER be back!\n\nthey talked us into staying last time but this is it! We are done here!,122818
3,"Good solid Panda Express.  It is in the Meadows Mall.  There is never too long of a line.  When I walked up and ordered a Panda bowl with vegetables side.  They made the veggies fresh while I waited.  Then I added the peppercorn shrimp.  I wish I go more than 6 shrimp with the veggies that come with the peppercorn shrimp, but my whole meal was a total of 270 calories.  It was filling and tasted good.  I enjoyed it.  \n\nWhen I am not on a diet, I enjoy the cream cheese ragoons.  The mall is right across from my work.  I have no complaints about this place.",394319
2,"I love casino coffee shops and I love late-night eats, but this place just annoys me. I'm a low-carb eater and it is like pulling teeth to get the kitchen to substitute a veggie or salad for their mounds of mashed potatoes. Really? I know starches are cheaper than some greens but come on! A restaurant ought to allow substitutions (even if the customer has to pay a little extra to get what they want). But nope. The food is fine, nothing outstanding but if you are hungry it'll do. The South Point's restaurants are not the star of the property. If you can, I'd try to eat elsewhere.",366910
2,"Definitely gone downhill since my last visit. Enough so for me to finally create a yelp log in and wrote a review. I usually get the southwest chicken salad which is, or WAS I should say, amazing! They no longer carry it, or several of their other choice selections they once offered, so I settled on an old favorite, the vegetarian greifo. Unfortunately, it was lacking toppings since they've changed their ordering/service style, and skimpy on what veggies they did remember to put on. Pretty disappointed. Hate companies that rely on the gimmick of their name rather than actual product.",405690
3,"This is a good place to grab a quick slice after making the old town bar rounds. I don't think I'd ever go out of my way to eat here, but it sure hits the spot when you've got a good buzz - location, location, location.",462570
1,"It's no wonder why olive garden and company are declining.   We sat at the bar and didn't get any service for over 10 minutes.   Open boxes, dirty dishes, empty cups lined the bar like a college kitchen.   Not a good experience we ended up walking out and ate at Abuelos next door.",39887
1,"If I could give them a zero, I would. \n\nMy group of 6 had reservations, and they still took an hour to seat us.  We were early and checked in multiple times.  When we got seated, there were plenty of tables......so what was the problem? \n\nI guess we got seated at a weird time because we couldn't order from the lunch menu because it was \""brunch\"" still, even though \""lunch\"" started 10 min later?  Whatever.  \n\nThe service was soooooooooooo slow -- it wasn't even busy.  The waiters were rude.  The food was not worth the wait or price.  The frozen hot chocolate tasted watered down, so I don't get why people rave about it.  \n\nIf you want food, go elsewhere.  If you want desserts, order from the takeout/to-go window I guess.  If you want nice ambiance or something, IT'S NOT HERE.  Walk the strip.  \n\nI left definitely NOT tummy stuffed.",382895

The Estate was a great place to photograph a wedding and a wonderful place to stay.,366832
1,"I worked in the Petsmart Pet Hotel (Scottsdale 101) for about a year. I wouldn't even let my parents take there dogs here. The managers yell and sometimes kick the dogs when they are blocking the door (doggy day camp), the cages are not large enough and extremely HOT in the summer time, and they are never given enough water. Also, if your dog is an \""individual\"", which means they don't go to doggy day camp, they aren't spayed/neutered, or just aggressive, they are usually never walked. Most dogs would also defecate in his or her cage and it wouldn't be cleaned up for a whole day. I remember some parents would complain that his or her pet would go home with poop stuck there fur. If you pay for your dog to go to doggy day camp, what people don't know is if your dog(s) annoy the Pet Hotel worker (barking, splashing water, jumping, etc.), they will take them out and keep him or her in there cage for the rest of the day and still charge you. And that cute little paw report you get that states who your pet played with? Sadly, most of it is made up. People who bring there dogs and cats in don't see this side of Petsmart. I quit here because I couldn't stand how these dogs and cats were being treated. Please do not take your dog here. It's not fair to him or her. My parents now take there furry children to D Pet Hotels in Scottsdale.",546491
5,"This buffet is located primely just east of Maryland Parkway on Flamingo. It is newly remodeled and very upscale. The food does not get better for the price (only $12.95 for dinner) and that's not to say anything about the food is below par. It's great! Even eating here at the very end of the evening, everything is fresh. The staff is extremely friendly and service is spectacular. I will be coming here over and over and referring my friends and colleagues as well. \n\nThanks for a great meal, Lees!\n\nP.S.

5,This place is great! My goto boba place in town. Very reasonably priced boba. Also I highly recommend you try their food. I have had the duck wraps and the egg and tomato ramen and both were really delicious. I don't know why their food isn't mentioned more cause its very very good. Way underrated in my opinion. Oh and everything is made from fresh ingredients. Can't beat that. Highly recommended!,504851
3,"Late nights here, but not in the ice room.\n\nAfter wandering the strip and partying up at a wedding Minus Five ended up being the late night place at the Mandalay that we would all end up at. \n\nWhile the drinks were good, and the service was spectacular they almost scammed us for 5 extra shots (at $10/shot).  My friend paid for them upfront, and then they showed up on the tab! We're drunk...but that NOT that drunk....that was so not cool.  I'd like to think this was an honest mistake....but I have to point this out. \n\nIf I hadn't been hanging out with a bunch of Hawaiians, I think I would hung out in the ice bar.
