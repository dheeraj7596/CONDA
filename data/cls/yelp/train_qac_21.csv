405690,"question : how is the service? 
 answer : bad 
 context : definitely gone downhill since my last visit. enough so for me to finally create a yelp log in and wrote a review. i usually get the southwest chicken salad which is, or was i should say, amazing! they no longer carry it, or several of their other choice selections they once offered, so i settled on an old favorite, the vegetarian greifo. unfortunately, it was lacking toppings since they've changed their ordering/service style, and skimpy on what veggies they did remember to put on. pretty disappointed. hate companies that rely on the gimmick of their name rather than actual product.

 context : good solid panda express.  it is in the meadows mall.  there is never too long of a line.  when i walked up and ordered a panda bowl with vegetables side.  they made the veggies fresh while i waited.  then i added the peppercorn shrimp.  i wish i go more than 6 shrimp with the veggies that come with the peppercorn shrimp, but my whole meal was a total of 270 calories.  it was filling and tasted good.  i enjoyed it.  \n\nwhen i am not on a diet, i enjoy the cream cheese ragoons.  the mall is right across from my work.  i have no complaints about this place.

 context : **update**\n\nokay, after staying at the alladin/ planet hollywood i am going to beg ballys to take us back!!!  i went back there my last day and everything was sunshine compared to the other hotel. i will just have to be super sweet and bat my eyelashes and wink at the receptionist (whether guy or girl) and beg for the newer cleaner rooms next time we are there. my guy and i figured that the people at the other hotel are so rude and arent ready to jump to keep you happy because they arent unionized. i am giving this hotel an upgrade to 4 stars. luv ya ballys!!!! ps... they do have comfortable beds & room service is also good. \n\n\nthis is one of the worst hotels. if you are the new side the rooms are a bit better. but still not up to par. we go there at least 3 times a year because of business and it sucks that the organization can only use this place. most of the time the check in people are rude.

 answer : excellent 
 context : this buffet is located primely just east of maryland parkway on flamingo. it is newly remodeled and very upscale. the food does not get better for the price (only $12.95 for dinner) and that's not to say anything about the food is below par. it's great! even eating here at the very end of the evening, everything is fresh. the staff is extremely friendly and service is spectacular. i will be coming here over and over and referring my friends and colleagues as well. \n\nthanks for a great meal, lees!\n\np.s. i don't know how the other reviews came to their decision on rating but, i find it very difficult to believe that anyone could leave this place one star.

 answer : bad 
 context : i love casino coffee shops and i love late-night eats, but this place just annoys me. i'm a low-carb eater and it is like pulling teeth to get the kitchen to substitute a veggie or salad for their mounds of mashed potatoes. really? i know starches are cheaper than some greens but come on! a restaurant ought to allow substitutions (even if the customer has to pay a little extra to get what they want). but nope. the food is fine, nothing outstanding but if you are hungry it'll do. the south point's restaurants are not the star of the property. if you can, i'd try to eat elsewhere.

484702,"question : how is the service? 
 answer : awful 
 context : what a difference a day can make!  yesterday my wife and her friends stopped at yoli's for breakfast on the way to the gem stone show in tucson. when she came home and she said we have to go back, that she really had enjoyed her breakfast.  so this morning i agreed to give it a try.  i'm a big fan of locally owned joints and always try to support those verses chain restaurants.   yoli's is off on a little side street in downtown chandler.  it's in a converted little bungalow that features some other little shops in a common courtyard.  when we walked in, 9:30ish, there were some tables available and a waitress walked by and told us to sit wherever we wanted.  around the same time several other couples came in and seated themselves.  customers around us seemed to be enjoying their meals and from what i could see they looked good.  we continued to see wait staff running around but nobody was acknowledging us, they could have said' \""sorry, we'll be with you in a moment\"".  now my wife is getting perturbed, i'm normally the one that says i'm outta here after 10 minutes but today for some reason i was being the voice of reason. finally after 18 minutes the same waitress comes by and asked if we have looked a menu yet, we didn't have any yet, we have no beverages or silverware - nothing!  she comes back with 1 and says that they don't have any extra menus and could we share this one.  still hasn't asked us if we would care to have anything to drink.  after she finished serving the table next to us she then asks if we would like anything to drink, finally!  she comes back with our coffee and waters and she takes our order.  when my wife inquires about the potato choice we are told that they are out of the country potatoes today.  its mid-morning and you are running out of potatoes already?  ok, so we get our ordered placed and start to enjoy our coffee.  in the mean time i'm noticing 2 couples sitting outside and they have been waiting at least 15 minutes and no one is acknowledging them, you can see them looking around to see if they can flag down help.  when they finally wait on them we notice that they are getting their coffee in paper cups.  then we hear another waitress tell the four top next to us that they have run out of coffee cups and hope they don't mind the paper ones.  my wife says they never had to wait the day before, which they had great service and the food was out in descent time.  not so today.  it's now been 40 minutes since we placed our order, the waitress comes out to the table next to use to ask who ordered the steak & peppers skillet, they reply that isn't our order, the waitress turns and looks at us (mind you now, she took our order) and says i wonder who ordered this.  i said that i also ordered the steak & pepper skillet and she says they wrote the wrong table number on the slip.  (it was you honey) she then hands me a menu and ask if i would like to order something else, that they are out of carne asada for that meal.  this tells me that the cooks aren't checking what is being ordered until they are preparing that meal or the waitress is not in tune with the kitchen.  either way that was the final straw for me.  we left and i'm disappointed for them.  you have to take care of your customers in a timely manner.  i could have over looked running out of some of the ingredients but not 40 minutes after you have taken my order.  someday, if you last, i will try you again.  good luck yoli's!

 answer : good 
 context : it's the bees knee's man! \n\nwe ducked into this spot on a rainy day for lunch and i'm so glad we did. my husband and i were sat right in front of the window and watch the cars splash by. i was going to order a red stripe (yes! they have red stripe) and the bartender suggested longboard which they have on tap. this malty beer was a joy to drink, so refreshing, it hit the spot. for lunch i had the hula's island cobb, very delicious. i was skeptical about the spam but it ended up being a great substitute for bacon. my only gripe is the chicken was described as \""marinated\"" on the menu which sold me on the salad but when i had it the meat was plain. my hubs had the luau pork sandwich and it's truly heaven on a bun, served with yummy sweet potato fries. both meals were large portions and we finished every bite. \n\nwe had a really good time at hula's, great service, delish food & beer. we will be going back fo sho! oh, and i should also mention that the silverware is now wrapped in cloth napkins. if i would have read these reviews before my visit amy's \""fork door holder\"" story would have kept me away.

534253,"question : how is the service? 
 answer : bad 
 context : i wouldn't go out of my way to go here again.  the food was \""eh\"" and i noticed almost everything was served in a bowl, so for example my burger was sitting on top of my already mushy fries.  my drink order was wrong and nobody came around again to find out if everything was ok with our food/drink, so that was that.  my sister went another time with her husband and she said they messed up her meal too.  the biggest thing i noticed was that there were literally only teenagers working there, so that probably plays a big role in the lackluster service.  my office chair was filthy when i went to sit down, so i tried to switch it with the one next to it, but it was dirty too.  if it wasn't for the great movie we saw (lawless!) then i would have really been bummed about the whole experience.  next time i'd rather just eat somewhere that i know the food/service is good, and go see a traditional movie.

143693,"question : how is the service? 
 answer : good 
 context : when you want something quick on this side of town, chinese, and reasonable, this is the place to go- been going to this one for years. i usually get the bowl with half white rice and half vegetables, with either the beef and broccoli or the mushroom chicken. i don't finish it, i save half for later. my husband gets the two item with half fried rice, half chow mein- beef & broccoli and orange chicken. sometimes he gets the pork but only if it's lean. sometimes, we each get an eggroll (when you complete the receipt survey within 2 days, this could be free). fortune cookies come with your meals.\n\nuniform design for this fast food chain restaurant. most of these restaurants are decorated the same: panda prints, red paint, tables/chairs, bar type tables/chairs. free refills on sodas. bathroom in one corner. open kitchen- cut veggies in clear bins kept in the refrigerator- i love that, though sometimes the veggies are pretty chunky. most of the food trays were full. there were three people working. this is a fairly busy but clean location that shares the parking lot with mcdonald's. it wasn't as busy yesterday but then again, we got there past 1 pm though. several strip malls in the area and close to the boulevard mall- convenient location.

 context : if i could give them a zero, i would. \n\nmy group of 6 had reservations, and they still took an hour to seat us.  we were early and checked in multiple times.  when we got seated, there were plenty of tables......so what was the problem? \n\ni guess we got seated at a weird time because we couldn't order from the lunch menu because it was \""brunch\"" still, even though \""lunch\"" started 10 min later?  whatever.  \n\nthe service was soooooooooooo slow -- it wasn't even busy.  the waiters were rude.  the food was not worth the wait or price.  the frozen hot chocolate tasted watered down, so i don't get why people rave about it.  \n\nif you want food, go elsewhere.  if you want desserts, order from the takeout/to-go window i guess.  if you want nice ambiance or something, it's not here.  walk the strip.  \n\ni left definitely not tummy stuffed.

 answer : bad 
 context : the map picture for this one is incorrect.  this location is actually at alma school and germann, in the fry's plaza.  i'll give a place 3 strikes before i say something heavily negative, and this is it for this joint.  one employee, jim, has ruined it for me.  i don't know if he's just an old school chauvinist, or if he's deeply insecure and mean-spirited, but he's waited on me 3 times.  every time condescending and rude.  and the last time i was so irritated, i just wanted to get out of there and when i got to the car i realized he didn't give me my change.  it was only a nickel, so no big deal.  i hope he can use that towards a customer service class.  \n\nif he's not there, it's fine and i like all the services that the ups store offers.  i used to travel all over the country for a company who has a corporate account with them and i would always get a+ service no matter where i went.  in the future i will use a different location.

425079,"question : how is the service? 
 answer : excellent 
 context : we came to this tapas and wine bar after having visited there on the tour de food uptown.  we shared rabbit pot pie that was succulent and flavorful.  there was a sweetness to the dish that was intriguing.  the vegetables retained some texture and added a pleasing crunch.  our next dish was lamb bahn mi sliders.  these were outstanding on crisp toasted bread, soft on the inside.  flavorful toppings made it very tasty. the crab cakes allowed the crab to be the star, but added enough garnish to make it unique.  finally we shared the red neck wedding cake which was outstanding.  the spicy nuts made the dish very interesting instead of just a good chocolate care with cheerwine(!) icing.  they are not afraid to go bold in this restaurant and it succeeds.  i hope they get more business so that they stay around!

 context : as far as the grocery section of this store is concerned,  it is pretty nice - seems like they might be having trouble adapting to a kroger plan-o-gram, as items are hard to find and their placement in the store doesn't always make sense.  the staff is as courteous as any i've encountered since moving here. \nnow -about the pharmacy - totally different attitudes and staff doesn't seem aware of what they are doing.  i had my prescriptions transferred from kroger in ohio - they were good until february 2015.  three of them fry's refilled and noted \""no refills\"" on the bottles; even though my doctor had approved.  they did not have one of my medications and said they had to order it.  that was okay with me.  this was on a tuesday and i was told the medication would be available on friday.  i went back on friday and the pharmacy worker told me that the order had come in but hadn't been unpacked yet.  at no time did he offer to go and get it for me.  i asked him what the cost was going to be (since i have new insurance) and he said, \""$25.00\"".  on saturday i went back to get it; and the woman pharmacy manager told me a price that was almost 10 times the one i was quoted the day before.  i pointed at the young man who had given me that price, and she said, \""how would he know?\""  i pointed out to her that he was looking in the same computer she was.  she turned to him and he looked at me and said he had never told me that...now, come  on, folks, i didn't pull that price out of thin air.\n\nto make a long story short, walgreen's now has a new customer.  go for groceries but steer clear of the pharmacy if you can...i would have been a bit appeased if someone had apologized and said it was an error - but i was offered no explanation or apology...guess the customer doesn't matter to the pharmacy techs.
