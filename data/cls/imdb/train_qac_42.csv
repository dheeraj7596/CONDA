989,"question : is this movie good or bad? 
 answer : bad 
 context : i got this movie for fifty cents at a going out of business sale. i want my fifty cents back. bad acting, poor script writing, lousy direction, historically inaccurate, even the sound of the film is awful. it's not the subject matter that offends. i'm one of the many who find suspense films and true crime films very interesting. the subject matter could have been treated more seriously, with much more attention to detail and accuracy, and the lack of respect shown for the victims and their devastated friends and family is enough to puzzle anyone. also, there is little to no attention paid to what could have caused someone to begin the bizarre behavior that ed gein was displaying in acting out these horrible crimes.   save your time and sanity. don't watch this awful film. if you bought it, you have my sympathy. it's not a total waste though...you can throw away the disc and make use of the plastic case!

321,"question : is this movie good or bad? 
 answer : bad 
 context : i am a german student so sorry for eventually mistakes (i'm working on it ;) )  the stylistic very interesting converted and with effective sound effects accentuated platitudinous action of the drama deflect in no way from the horrible bad actors (insincere and unnatural moves and expressions of feelings) and makes so the relatively weird and senseless story less better. just the typical slasher-genre with in this case very odd action. many by-plays destroy partly the main story and let the viewers up to the end into the dark, create weirdness and let surmise the senses of actions and the point mere hazily. for sure its an hit for slasher-fans but not for me. but although the interesting style of cinematography and adeptly use of light is turned out well.  so not the best one...

 answer : good 
 context : this gem for gore lovers is extremely underrated. it's pure delight and fun! gratuitous servings of blood, insanity and black humor, which can please even the most demanding lover of the genre. a full exploitation of the almost universal fear of dentists and flawlessly shot. only for the connoisseurs.

 answer : bad 
 context : my girlfriend picked this one; as a southern born and raised african american i found this movie's plot and premise totally without credibility. to believe that class and racial biases would be so easily and comfortably suspended would only come from someone totally unfamiliar with the ante-bellum south. totally absurd !!! i wonder how they got a good actor like harvey keitel and a good actress like andie mcdowell (who being southern knows better) to participate in this crap

591,"question : is this movie good or bad? 
 answer : good 
 context : okay, i'll admit right up front that the inki cartoons made by loony tunes are pretty offensive and i can understand why warner brothers has pulled them off the market. seen today, the huge-lipped and very stereotypical inki is not politically correct. however, the cartoons were well-made and it's a shame they aren't released with some sort of explanatory prologue (such as the one with leonard maltin they included with some recent politically incorrect donald duck cartoons that were recently released on dvd). in other words, throwing out the cartoons completely is to forget our history. plus, inki, little black sambo and other racist cartoons are out there--especially on the internet.  this inki cartoon has our little hero out hunting. at first, he's chasing a cute little caterpillar but later accidentally happens upon a lion--a lion that is more than happy to make inki his dinner. however, through all this, a weird minah appears again and again...and eventually you'll see why this bird is so important to the story.  cute, well made and clever. i like the inki cartoons. plus, i take pleasure in showing them to extremely thin-skinned liberal friends just to watch them have apoplectic fits or even heart attacks. loads of fun, folks!

514,"question : is this movie good or bad? 
 answer : bad 
 context : ok this movie was by far worse then the first one and the first one sucked! the zombie make up was extremely fake! the acting is very poor! and it doesn't really follow the first one! while watching this i kept thinking wow the first one is a masterpiece compared to this. i would say catch it on tv, don't spend your money on it! its not the worst movie i've ever seen but its on the list. i started watching it last night and fell asleep so i watched it today and almost fell asleep again! the plot was pointless, i mean i get the fact that a small military group are sent on a mission to get the blood of the lead zombie and bring it back so they can use it to save lives and stop zombies but they made it where you wanted everyone to die. they made plenty of bad guys who really were just annoying. if you ask me this was a rip off of resident evil and not a good rip off either. the plot could have made it if the acting was good and if they actually made you feel scared to see whats behind the corner. with these zombies my grandma could have went in that building and survived! out of a 1-10 i give it a 2.

684,"question : is this movie good or bad? 
 answer : bad 
 context : ok this movie had a terrible premise. be serious according to the movie they had just been through an apocalyptic war yet they have money to buy huge robots and pit them against each other. each country decides instead of investing into rebuilding their country they would rather fight with robots no one could afford. here's a better idea, lets rely on our most inept resource,jocks, to fight our battles.   everyone says what about the director, what about him. he makes a good movie, he makes a bad movie. there is no reason to give this movie some credit just because of the director, maybe he was asleep? i thoroughly enjoyed this movie, because it was so cheesy and ridiculous i had to laugh. i actually had a good time watching it, well except for the cowboy mentor who turns out to be an assassin(trust me no one would see this guy as an assassin, so it is a surprise, however lame) what kind of training exercise is a jungle jim anyway. i was sad to see mst3k had not done this one. i am giving a two star rating however because nothing could be as bad as ""manos the hands of fate.""  the budget does not matter either, i have seen plenty of reasonable movies that had nothing for budgets like cube. the storyline was not even plausible and i have seen better acting in school plays. surly they could have afforded an eleven year old from any middle school play.  anyway pick it up, it is a fun movie to watch.

825,"question : is this movie good or bad? 
 answer : good 
 context : i haven't read the anne rice novel that this movie was based on, but who knows, maybe reading the book is cheaper than renting queen of the damned and is probably better for your health. it isn't that this movie is necessarily bad for your health, but a book can be very relaxing and certainly exercises the active part of your brain more so than this movie. you can count the number of pages by anne rice that i've read on one hand, but after seeing this movie and interview with a vampire, i get the feeling that she writes really good novels. the plots for both movies hint at a whole sea of deep and interwoven vampire history.  still, stuart townsend's voice-over narration gets a heck of a lot more annoying than brad pitt's vampire narrative ever did, and you can tell that queen of the damned's limited production resources barely give enough flesh to the anne rice storyline. while interview decided to go with lace and elegance, queen relies on low budget special effects that try really hard to be taken seriously. one can see that the original novel had potential as a movie and that the production team focused its attention in the wrong places. the costumes and rock & roll stage could have been replaced with more blood and an eerier soundtrack.  however, i'll give credit where credit is due. the soundtrack is excellent. korn and disturbed had me down with the sickness bobbing my noggin like butthead.  the film opens with a very cool goth-rock zoom & splice montage, but after the first ten minutes or so, the directing degenerates quickly. it's as if the movie was so long that the director realized that there wasn't enough time and enough money to do an anne rice novel justice. what results are some mediocre vampire scenes and plenty of cheesy special effects. unfortunately, queen of the damned fails to do the genre justice just as its john carpenter counterparts fail to impress. where are the yellow contacts? where's the pale blue make-up? scene after scene, i shook my head reminiscing about the days of salem's lot and fright night when low budget was done right.  there are redeeming qualities though that save this movie from being garbage. props to aaliyah, and may her soul forever rest in peace. she might have become a renowned actress, had her life not been taken from us so prematurely, for she did give this movie a decent performance with plenty of nice belly dancing. did i mention that the soundtrack was good? let's see, what else can i say? it wasn't too long. the anne rice novel could have easily been a three hour movie if an ambitious director like francis ford coppola got his hands on it. there are a few twists and turns here and there in the plot. but all in all it was a legitimate rock and roll addition to the slew of second-rate vampire movies out there. the director of this movie went on to direct a new battlestar galactica mini series if that tells you anything.  jy  jimboduck-dot-com

359,"question : is this movie good or bad? 
 answer : good 
 context : my mother frank begins as a warm, amiable comedy about a middle-aged catholic woman (frank, short for francis, played by sinead cusack) who shakes herself out of the doldrums by enrolling as a student in her son's university. most of her friends and family are horrified, not least her son (matthew newton), who is busy falling in love with his best mate's girlfriend (rose byrne). meanwhile frank has raised the ire of her disapproving english tutor (sam neill).  matthew newton is utterly disarming as david; relaxed and natural in the role, even when the character's uptight. he generates valuable goodwill, steering the audience through some of the film's more awkward, broad comedy moments. not long after the half-way point, first-time writer-director mark lamprell expertly steers his film into darker emotional territory and gives cusack a real chance to shine.  the supporting cast is full of familiar and welcome faces (lynette curran, sacha horler, nicholas bishop) and all the principals (including a more animated than usual sam neill) are excellent. while it meanders a little towards the end, my mother frank delivers more than it promises and is a genuine australian crowd-pleaser.

14,"question : is this movie good or bad? 
 answer : bad 
 context : blood legacy starts with the arrival of lawyer tom drake (norman bartold) to the dean estate formerly owned by the now deceased christopher dean (john carradine), upon his arrival he is greeted by mr. dean's four children, gregory (jeff morrow) & his wife laura (merry anders), victoria (faith domergue), johnny (richard davalos) plus leslie (brooke mills) & her fella carl isenberg (john smith). drake plays a tape recording of they're late father's wishes after his death, the estate worth 136 million dollars is to be split equally between his four children, if any should die then the money would be split equally between the rest & if all were to die the freaky servants elga (ivy bethune), igor (buck kartalian) & the more mundanely named frank (john russell) would pocket the lot. well, not satisfied with a quarter share of $136 million (which is still almost $35 million back in 1971 which doesn't sound too bad to me) someone decides they want it all for themselves & it's not long before decapitated heads are turning up in the fridge...  co-written, produced & directed by roy monson blood legacy disappointed me on two accounts. for starters this film's alternate & much more common title is legacy of blood which is also the title of an obscure horror film directed by andy milliagn back in '78 which i've always wanted to see, both films are regularly mixed up as both have similar stories & when i checked my on screen cable tv guide for legacy of blood i was excited because it said it was the milligan film & even listed him as director so when i actually sat down to watch it & i heard john carradine's voice & i then knew it wasn't the milligan film that i had wanted to see, my heart sank. then, of course, there's the simple yet undeniably straight forward fact that blood legacy is a total utter piece of crap that is literally painful to watch at times. the script by monson & eric norden is slow, boring & extremely predictable. the character's are absolutely bizarre in an annoying way, the freak of a servant who ask's his sister (?) to cane him, the strange set of brother's & sisters who are just downright unlikeable & so far removed from reality that any tension or mystery that the simplistic whodunit story could have achieved is sorely missing & then there's the awful twist ending that you can guess within the first 10 minutes. it's boring to watch, it's poorly paced & it's just a chore to even think about it. please, someone save me as this is really bad stuff. i could go on all day about how bad blood legacy is, i really could.  director monson was either working with a none existent budget or judging by this he shouldn't have even been directing traffic. the entire film looks ugly, it's poorly photographed & there is no atmosphere or scares. the blood & gore is tame, there's an axe in a head, a decapitated head, a scene when someone is stung to death by wasp's & the best murder when someone's face is eaten by piranha. however there are question marks over this scene, so there's the victim, right. there's the tank of piranha, right. victims head is placed in piranha tank, right. pirahna eat victims face, right. water remains crystal clear despite said victim having his face eaten, erm where's the blood?  technically blood legacy is terrible, it looks awful, the sound was obviously shot live & it's muffled & hard to hear which considering the terrible dialogue is maybe a blessing in disguise. the acting was not going to win anyone any awards that's for sure, the least said about it the better.  blood legacy is an awful film, there really isn't a single positive aspect to it or if there is i can't think of it. do yourself a favour & don't bother with this one, there are much better films out there.

162,"question : is this movie good or bad? 
 answer : good 
 context : krajobraz po bitwie like many films of wajda is, perhaps, not understandable for the ""rest of the world"". story based on the few short stories of tadeusz borowski, who during wwii was the prisoner of oswiecim, dachau and dautmergen camps. borowski in his books describes inhuman life in the nazi camps from the point of view vorarbeiter tadek - porte parole of author who also was on the privileged position among the prisoners. borowski was merciless for the humanity and merciless for himself. he describes the human history as the endless chain of exploitation and humiliation. ironically, after the returning to poland he stopped writing artistic prose and became communistic propagandist, producing stream of anti-imperialistic and anti-american press publications. after few years he committed suicide. in the movie wajda changes point of view. vorarbeiter tadek - character created by the tadeusz janczar - plays only supporting role. story is focused on the poet, destroyed, burned out by the war and imprisonement and his one-day love affair with nina, jewish girl who escaped from communistic poland although she actually hates jewish life and mentality. as the background we can observe sad grotesque of so-called ""dipis"" (displaced persons) life, who after the liberation are settled by the americans in ss barracks. marches, patriotic kitsch mixed with hunting for the extra dose of food and/or prostituting german girls.

 answer : good 
 context : german-born turkish director faith akin captures in his film the endless variety of the different styles in music and songs in istanbul, a city that is a bridge between east and west, a city that is uniquely located on both sides of the bosporus, in europe and in asia. kurdish dirges represented by aynur, who performs her own brand of kurdish gospel music, passionate and melodic. we are introduced to romany instrumentals, to orhan gencebay, who has been called the elvis of arabesque music - sounds of music are heard everywhere in the city as faith akin takes us into underground clubs, to the street performers, and to recording sessions. german bassist alexander hacke who comes to istanbul to play and to learn about turkish music quotes confucius, ""to understand the place, you have to listen to the music it plays"". akin's fine documentary does just that - gives us 90 minutes of music that helps to cross the bridges. for me, watching the movie was especially interesting because i recently visited istanbul as a part of my vacation and spent four days there. the city fascinated me by its images, colors, crowds, vibrancy and visual beauty. now, i can add the sounds of music to the ever-changing portrait of istanbul.

164,"question : is this movie good or bad? 
 answer : bad 
 context : if you liked ""blair with"" you'll like this one. it has the same lousy camera-work and soundtrack, and it has the same non-existent plot and suspenseful moments.  it also has tom savini, so if you like romero's ""dawn of the dead"" or tarantino and rodriguez' ""from dusk till dawn"" you're in for a treat. he is an icon and a very good actor as well.  no, seriously. this movie is definitely the lousiest movie i've seen in a long time, and i've seen quite a few movies -- bad ones as well. i can tell you that i find most horror movies entertaining in some respect, but this was just a pure waste of time.  the only reason why i gave this movie 2 instead of 1, was the naked chicks and the hot action with all the sharp-looking plastic teeth... no, i'm just kidding. i must have missed before i hit ""submit"" on the vote form.  stay away, even though it has sexy girls with teeth on the cover!
