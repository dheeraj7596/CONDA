657,"question : is this movie good or bad? 
 answer : good 
 context : in the late 1940s there was a short film series entitled ""flicker flashbacks"" in which excerpts from silent dramas featuring the likes of mary pickford and blanche sweet were played for laughs. scratchy clips from antiquated old movies were rearranged, projected too fast, and given an overlay of jangly music and lame quips. the attitude expressed through this brutal treatment pretty much summed up mid-century hollywood's view of its early days: silent cinema was considered hokey, florid, a little embarrassing, and only good for a chuckle. during the 1950s this attitude gradually began to change for a number of reasons. james agee's famous 1949 essay on the silent clowns for life magazine was a factor, but television played a major role in reacquainting viewers with silent movies. admittedly, the tv networks sometimes handled the material as crudely as the ""flicker flashbacks"" people, but higher-toned series such as ""silents, please"" treated the films with respect. another milestone was robert youngson's compilation feature the golden age of comedy, which proved to be something of a surprise hit when it was released to theaters late in 1957.  i don't know if charles chaplin was aware of youngson's film or its success at the box office, but it was around this time that he decided to launch a theatrical re-release of three of his best short comedies, a dog's life, shoulder arms (both made in 1918), and the pilgrim (made in 1922 and released the following year). these three movies happened to work well as a trio since they contrast nicely in plot, theme, and setting. in addition, all three feature familiar faces from chaplin's stock company, some of whom play multiple roles in each short. at the time of the re-release the films hadn't been publicly screened in over thirty years, so perhaps chaplin was concerned about maintaining his reputation with a new generation of movie-goers, especially since his best work was seldom shown on television in the new medium's early days.  unfortunately, chaplin apparently concluded that the films moved too quickly at the old silent projection speed, so the decision was made to ""stretch-print"" them, which meant that every other frame was printed twice. maybe he wanted to avoid the 'flicker flashbacks' look, but this wasn't the best way to go about it. aesthetically speaking, the results were awful and practically destroyed the movies' flow of action, but nonetheless that's how the chaplin revue was released to theaters in 1959, and that's the version that was transferred to video and made commercially available by playhouse video in the 1980s. i purchased a vhs copy of the movie at the time and was terribly disappointed with the jerky, stop-and-start rhythm of the films.  it's a particular pleasure to find that david shepard's restoration of chaplin's compilation (originally produced for the laser-disc format) is a vast improvement over the playhouse video version. for the most part, the projection speed has been corrected. the ""stretch-printing"" is gone at any rate, though the action seems to drag a bit at times. for example: in a dog's life during edna & charlie's awkward dance in the green lantern cafe, edna's bare arms appear visibly blurred; at another point, during the trench scene in shoulder arms when charlie is relieved from sentry duty, the action appears oddly slowed-down for a few moments, but this may be the result of a maneuver by the film restorers to cover a bit of decomposition. over all, picture quality is fantastic considering the age of the movies themselves.  other bonuses: the revue begins with rare behind-the-scenes footage taken at the chaplin studio. this includes shots of an obviously staged, jokey rehearsal session where chaplin throttles diminutive actor loyal underwood, as well as scenes of charlie at his dressing table putting on his makeup and trimming the famous mustache. these scenes are accompanied by chaplin's narration, delivered at a rapid clip. chaplin also composed a new musical score for the compilation, and in my opinion his themes for the revue rank with his best compositions, especially the pieces used during the caf√© sequence in a dog's life. the only exception is the song written for the pilgrim, a pseudo-singin' cowboy number called ""bound for texas"" sung 'fifties-style by matt monro (sounding rather like gene autry), which is distractingly anachronistic and out of place. otherwise, throughout the rest of the revue, the music is perfectly suited to the action and the atmosphere.  it feels as though the image release of the chaplin revue is, in a sense, its long-postponed debut, presenting these classic comedies the way they were meant to be seen all along. in this form, the revue ranks with chaplin's most durable and enjoyable works.

 answer : bad 
 context : i saw this movie in the theatre and it was a terrible movie. the way michael oliver who now turn even worse in the sequel is the biggest intolerance i cannot bare. junior upset his father because he would not go to school which got his father ben madly insane. also the crazy dance ride operator is not fair to junior for not letting him go on the ride. and that lawanda dumore is as horrible as a serial killer to junior because she made threatening insults to junior which is why i cannot tolerate this movie. even if the movie is re-released back into theatres in the extended version, i still would not see this movie because this movie is not something i can even tolerate. in fact, it stinks!

 answer : good 
 context : minor spoilers  alison parker (cristina raines) is a successful top model, living with the lawyer michael lerman (chris sarandon) in his apartment. she tried to commit suicide twice in the past: the first time, when she was a teenager and saw her father cheating her mother with two women in her home, and then when michael's wife died. since then, she left christ and the catholic church behind. alison wants to live alone in her own apartment and with the help of the real state agent miss logan (ava gardner), she finds a wonderful furnished old apartment in brooklyn heights for a reasonable rental. she sees a weird man in the window in the last floor of the building, and miss logan informs that he is father francis matthew halloran (john carradine), a blinded priest who lives alone supported by the catholic church. alison moves to her new place, and once there, she receives a visitor: her neighbor charles chazen (burgess meredith) welcomes her and introduces the new neighbors to her. then, he invites alison to his cat jezebel's birthday party in the night. on the next day, weird things happen with alison in her apartment and with her health. alison looks for miss logan and is informed that she lives alone with the priest in the building. a further investigation shows that all the persons she knew in the party were dead criminals. frightened with the situation, alison embraces christ again, while michael investigates the creepy events. alison realizes that she is living in the gateway to hell.   although underrated in imdb user rating, 'the sentinel' is one of the best horror movies ever. i have seen this film at least six times, being the first time in the 70's, in the movie theater. in 07 september 2002, i bought the imported dvd and saw it again. yesterday i saw this movie once more. even after so many years, this film is still terrific. the creepy and lurid story frightens even in the present days. the cast is a constellation of stars and starlets. you can see many actors and actresses, who became famous, in the beginning of career. fans of horror movie certainly worships 'the sentinel', and i am one of them. my vote is nine.  title (brazil): 'a sentinela dos malditos' ('the sentinel of the damned')  obs.: on 02 september 2007, i saw this movie again.

280,"question : is this movie good or bad? 
 answer : good 
 context : i got this movie out a week after the death of ichikawa kon - i suppose if there is one way to mark the passing of a great director, its to raise a glass of wine to him while watching one of his greatest movies. ichikawa had one of the finest careers in japanese film, but as he never had a distinctive style or theme he often seems to be overlooked compared to his near contemporaries such as ozu and kurosawa (he was a little younger than them, but not by much). he is one of those directors who defies auteur theories - its likely that his wife (who wrote the screenplay for this and many other of his movies) was as much responsible for the quality of the movies as he was. but at his best, he was as good as any japanese film maker at the time. in particular, he had great technical skills, allowing him to tell complex stories in an accessible manner. but in terms of theme, this movie could hardly be simpler - war is hell. no really, its seriously hell.  fire on the plain doesn't follow the normal war genre rules. there is no real beginning - we start as the wretched tamura, who is a regular private (although it is implied he is more thoughtful and educated than most of the others - at one stage it is shown he understands english, but he clams up when the others ask him how he knows it) is ordered to hospital, as his unit is already in an appalling state. the soldiers are defeated and starving to death. they are no longer an army, just a rag bag group of refugees - hunted by the locals, and pretty much ignored by the americans, who have bigger fish to fry. hunger and despair is driving the soldiers to the edge and beyond of madness.  in typical ichikawa style, its not all just grim - its oddly funny in parts (a very black humour of course).  the high points of this movie to me are the outstanding performances from the leads and the vivid photography. the characters, in all their humanity, but also their complete loss of humanity, are all too believable. this is that rare film - one which will refuse to erase itself from your head, even if you want to forget it.

727,"question : is this movie good or bad? 
 answer : bad 
 context : even duller, if possible, than the original (i hope i may say that under the imdb guidelines). the french connection at least tried to absorb european influences, to complicate the conventional view of the american police detective, even if the attempt was foundered by friedkin's ambivalence, americaness and general indirection. the (relative) arthouse boom of the 1960s (especially with the nouvelle vague) allowed for a huge influence of european cinema in hollywood. this lent a new vigour and complexity to a weary medium, and, in the best of them (eg bonnie and clyde, early scorcese), a new subversion of received practice. the original connection was part of this movement, with its difficultly distanced style, and anti-detective figure. two is old hollywood's right-wing reassertion of american values.  this is figured in the film's very tiresome america vs france dialectic. for instance, two is shot like a 70s french policier. it was the french, of course, who insisted on the greatness of american movies when they were ignored at home, and this, in a sense, is a reclamation, a warning against gallic presumption. this can be seen in the pattern of the two movies. connection has french gangsters invading new york, with the french style smothering the american thriller - this leads to the dissolution of the detective figure, and irresolution of plot - the baddie got away.   two has the american returning to france, with american thriller values imposed on the native genre - the power of the detective is reasserted and conventional resolution is achieved. this is further dramatised in doyle's relationship with french inspector barthelmy, whose dominant influence he must shake off before he can control the plot.  two seems to follow the original by undermining its detective hero. from the start, doyle's importance is diminished at every turn. despite the ending of connection, he is considered a hero. but he is an american in a foreign land, and his inability to control language or customs means he cannot dominate the plot. he even misreads the signs of the police force, mistaking an informer for a criminal, and getting him killed.   a detective's power comes from his power as subject to see and interpret, but doyle spends much of the movie being watched, controlled, an object, a body (literally in the scenes after he is dumped by charnier) to be viewed and interpreted. in connection, he instigated the action, chasing the criminals, forcing the plot; here he is passive, tied to a bed, locked in a cell, an addict, a dependent.  this loss of phallic power is predictably symbolised in the loss of his gun, and the film follows a depressingly familiar oedipal trajectory. in the heroin sequences, he is comforted by an old lady who says he looks like her son. his drugged state is like a return to the womb, robbed of adult pressures. her taking his watch reinforces the timelessness of this state, doubly significant for a man whose career depends on timetables and precision.  oedipus was the first detective, and to avoid his fate, doyle must reject this false mother who is dissolving his unified identity, and kill the father (charnier) so that he can take his accepted masculine role in society. psychoanalytic theory was popular among academics in the 70s(ironically instigated by a frenchman, jacques lacan), but it's rare to see a film so literally full of it.   if all of these facts tended towards the minimising of doyle, then the film's style doesn't. friedkin distanced us from his hero by refusing empathy or character motivation, focusing on the mechanics of plot. here, doyle is a very conventional hollywood hero. instead of being lost in murky long shot, he is made knowable and understandable to the viewer with the traditional devices - point-of-view shots, close ups, connecting shots etc.  two is all about the fall and rise of popeye doyle. plot in this case is subservient to the acting, which is the usual hackman showiness. the cold turkey scenes, therefore, despite their tediousness, are not disturbing. we are allowed to share rather than coldly observe; this a far less discomforting experience. the scenes are also shot through with a lachrymose manly sentimentality that is very american.   so while connection tried to imitate the complex thrillers of jean pierre melville, two does the complete opposite. melville's le samourai featured a gangster who started the film whole, powerful, outside language, and charted his eventual disintegration. two starts with a disintegrated character, achieved partly through inability with language, whose dominance begins when he steps outside language - the concluding action sequences are largely wordless.   in the film, the locale and language are important as they fixed and undermined the detective, but as he regains his power (figured in the return of his gun, and the cathartic burning of the primal site of vulnerability, the tower block where charnier held him), the marseilles setting becomes more irrelevant, and the mythic stand-off, which could take place anywhere, takes over. compare the endings of the two films: one admits ambiguity and despair, the other absolute certainty.

 answer : good 
 context : this is a cartoon series where most of the action takes place in the human body where the actors are vitamins, viruses, blood cells etc. i will not try to explain it in more details, you will simply have to see it for yourself: you will not be disappointed.  i remember watching this as a kid in the 80s (with swedish voices). i have talked with a few people who were also children in the 80s and they loved it also! i must admit that the education-part of the episodes didn't get through to me at a conscious level but the whole idea of educating children while they have fun is wonderful. i have recently seen a few episodes; there is a humour and heart in it that is hard to find in other children programs nowadays.  5/5

135,"question : is this movie good or bad? 
 answer : bad 
 context : this is a typical late universal horror flick: its technically comptent, if by the numbers, with a cookie cutter plot and some serious overacting. the most interesting part of this film is its stunt casting of rondo hatton, a man with a bone disease as the film's ""monster"". its sad to see this man exploited, but he probably made good use of the money they paid him. hatton is less horrifying than the studio hoped, as i more often felt pity over fear or even loathing. martin koslack is on board as the film's mad artist, and he is very amusing in this part. i for one enjoy seeing koslack in just about anything; for some reason the man amuses me. the only other part of the film that entertained me is the film's absurd take on the art world. here we are shown evil art critics who revel in their ability to break artists; this is side by side with the film's male ""hero"" who is an ""artist"" who paints...get this...pin up girls. somehow our hero's work is reviewed side by side with the villan's absurdist sculpture. also amusing is the film's chief nasty critic, who at one point claims that he despises the hero's pin up art because ""women like that don't exist"" to which our heroine replies with an assurance that the critic just doesn't get out enough. finally, there's a bit of a subplot about the heroine's (who is an art critic herself) domestication by the leading man....completely anti-feminist and ridiculous to witness. overall this film is a rather mediocre picture with a few amusing elements.

 answer : good 
 context : previous reviewer claudio carvalho gave a much better recap of the film's plot details than i could. what i recall mostly is that it was just so beautiful, in every sense - emotionally, visually, editorially - just gorgeous.  if you like movies that are wonderful to look at, and also have emotional content to which that beauty is relevant, i think you will be glad to have seen this extraordinary and unusual work of art.  on a scale of 1 to 10, i'd give it about an 8.75. the only reason i shy away from 9 is that it is a mood piece. if you are in the mood for a really artistic, very romantic film, then it's a 10. i definitely think it's a must-see, but none of us can be in that mood all the time, so, overall, 8.75.

197,"question : is this movie good or bad? 
 answer : bad 
 context : and maybe, as fred sandford used to say, ""one across the lips"". that to those who released this film on an unsuspecting public. and perhaps to the person in ""rue morgue"" who called this a ""fender hellbender"" and said it was good.  five young girls, apparently taking a short-cut home from a high school football game, become lost and stop to ask directions at some small store in the middle of nowhere. while there the driver accidentally hits a parked suv & knocks out a headlight, but the girls all decide to just leave & not go find the driver. but the driver does come to find them, and it's not just that the headlight on her vehicle got dinged, it's for another reason that the girls do not yet understand. when the driver does first catch them she (yes, it's a she) brandishes a shot gun & makes them strip down, and keeps screaming at them, ""how much did you see?"". of course the girls are scared to death & don't know what she's talking about.  as the night rolls on the girls end up in a cat and mouse game with the driver of the suv, who manages to inflict all manner of injuries on the girls, who are remarkably resilient to shot gun blasts and screwdrivers where they didn't want them. eventually they come to find that something happened back at that store after they left that is the reason for this woman's psychotic rage. and eventually they have a chance at revenge and take it about as far as they can go.  there are elements of this film that are rather disturbing and scary, but unfortunately, those moments are undermined by bad acting, bad dialog, and huge lapses of credibility. one girl is hit by a shot gun blast and appears to be mortally wounded, and she's feeling cold, her life is passing before her eyes, but she got better? and how far can a mini-van run on an almost empty gas tank at speeds of 80 miles per hour? i need one of those things, it apparently gets great mileage.  there should have been an ending when the girls got their revenge, but the film goes on for a bit after that, which is an anti-climax, but they at least learn some of what set the woman off, and the driver is still worried about ""messing up her mom's van"", which is obviously the least of anyone's worries.  so this isn't the worst film i've seen, but it's too amateur to be good and yet a bit too scary and gruesome at times to be completely terrible. but it does take the cake for plenty of shrill hysterics and you'll want to put two across your ears if you watch this. which, by the way, i don't necessarily recommend. 4 out of 10.

918,"question : is this movie good or bad? 
 answer : bad 
 context : when i got this movie free from my job, along with three other similar movies.. i watched then with very low expectations. now this movie isn't bad per se. you get what you pay for. it is a tale of love, betrayal, lies, sex, scandal, everything you want in a movie. definitely not a hollywood blockbuster, but for cheap thrills it is not that bad. i would probably never watch this movie again. in a nutshell this is the kind of movie that you would see either very late at night on a local television station that is just wanting to take up some time, or you would see it on a sunday afternoon on a local television station that is trying to take up some time. despite the bad acting, clich√© lines, and sub par camera work. i didn't have the desire to turn off the movie and pretend like it never popped into my dvd player. the story has been done many times in many movies. this one is no different, no better, no worse.   just your average movie.

419,"question : is this movie good or bad? 
 answer : bad 
 context : the plot was very thin, although the idea of naked, sexy, man eating sirens is a good one.  the film just seemed to meander from one meaningless scene to another with far too few nuddie/splatter/lesbian mouth licking shots in between.  the characters were wooden and one dimensional.  the ending made no sense.  considering it had tom savini and shaun hutson in it, you would have expected a decent plot and decent special effects. some of the effects were quite good but there were just too few of them.  brownie points go for occasional flashes of tits and bush, naturally, and of course the lesbian moments. i also thought that the scene with the sirens bathing in the pool under the waterfall could be viewed as an innovative take on the 'shower scene'  the film had many of the elements that go into making a first rate horror film but they were poorly executed or used too sparsely.  if i had been watching this alone and aged 15, i would have really enjoyed it for about 10 minutes (with 1 hand of the remote control), then lost interest suddenly and needed a pizza...

917,"question : is this movie good or bad? 
 answer : bad 
 context : first of all, the actor they have to play jesus has blue eyes... half the actors they have playing jews have blue eyes. aren't there enough brown-eyed actors out there? jesus being depicted as having blue eyes is one of my pet peeves. he was a full-blooded jew! second of all, what is it with old english-language movies that are supposed to take place in non-english-speaking countries, and everybody has english accents? (another example is david lean's ""dr. zhivago"".) aren't there enough either jewish actors or actors who can do a israeli accent? the movie often is not true to the scriptures, and so seems to doubt the legitimacy of jesus's claim to be the messiah. in the bible, when jesus is baptized by john, a voice comes from heaven saying ""this is my beloved son, in whom i am well pleased"" (matthew 3:17, mark 1:11, luke 3:22). in the movie, john the baptist says this! the screenwriter seems to be trying to portray the believers as crazy, as well. for example, in the bible, the angel gabriel tells mary she will become pregnant with the son of god (luke 1:26-38), but in the movie, we do not see or hear any angel - mary appears to be talking to a moonbeam, and when mary's mother hears her talking to someone and peeks in on her, she doesn't hear or see anyone either. also, in the movie, when jesus is speaking to the pharisees in the temple in jerusalem, he says, ""you shall not see me here again, not until you learn to cry, 'blessed is he who comes in the name of the lord', for i and my father are one and the same."" the correct line (matthew 23:39 and luke 13:35)is ""you will not see me again until you say, 'blessed is he who comes in the name of the lord.'"" period. jesus never claimed to be god. the movie cuts out a lot of important parts (the sermon on the mount is very expurgated), but then spends a lot of time on stuff that isn't even in the bible (a whole scene with mary magdalene talking with a john). it seems like the screenwriter, instead of wanting to do a movie version of the scriptures, wanted to make a movie about what he thinks might have really happened behind (and between) the scenes. the movie has one gem though - during the scene where jesus tells the parable of the prodigal son, at matthew the tax collector's house, i had tears streaming down my face. it is the best movie i've seen about jesus's ministry (but that isn't saying much, because the others are just terrible). ""jesus christ superstar"" is my favourite movie about jesus's last days (""the passion of the christ"" is way too graphic), though i like how ""jesus of nazareth"", instead of just ending with jesus's death, continues on and shows his resurrection.

279,"question : is this movie good or bad? 
 answer : good 
 context : ""pixote: a lei do mais fraco"" deals with what is perhaps the greatest of all brazilian themes: poverty. and along with poverty the other unnatural feelings and actions it brings; prostitution, violence, crime, rape and murder.  brazil is the country of paradoxes, and its social problems are present everywhere. the difference between the rich and the poor; the beautiful and the ugly; happiness and the most profound human decay.  ""pixote"" is one of the films that dare to touch and open these so painful wounds, and does it without the slightest glimmer of hope, in an honest portrayal of a country that, like pixote himself, is already lost.
