988,"question : is this movie good or bad? 
 answer : bad 
 context : i've never been a big larry clark fan, but somehow, i've been dragged to almost every single one of his movies. now, i like independent films, and i grew up very much into punk rock, and i'd like to say that this film is disappointing to both audiences. not every punk song incorporates ""oi!"" into its choruses, as they do in this particular film.  but the real problem with this film is that it switches moods every fifteen minutes or so and lacks any kind of cohesion. clark has made his living pretending that his fictionalized stories are ""how kids really are,"" and as such, you'll allow him ten minute scenes of stupid dialog that go nowhere, because that's the cinema verite feel he's going for. however, when he shoots a ridiculous death scene (pick any of them, save for the opening drive-by), the over-stylized attempts at what i assume is intended to be black humor are completely out of context, ridiculously shot (in most cases, far worse than a student film) and absolutely ludicrous in terms of the story. john cassavettes and ""date movie"" make poor bedfellows, as the forays into the latter style take you out of any kind of reality to remind you that you're watching a movie - a really, really bad one at that.

207,"question : is this movie good or bad? 
 answer : good 
 context : i have waited for ages to comment on this programme, and felt it was about time some justice was done to it. this is one of christie's darker, more sinister and engaging works, not simply someone being killed for money, this is a dark and thoroughly engaging tale of mystery, intrigue, love and murder, made all the better by the amendments made by the adaptor. the level of acting is utterly superb, joan hickson is sublime in the part, as always! the rest of the cast, including the likes of liz fraser, anna cropper and helen cherry all perform beautifully, but it's my opinion that the show is stolen by margaret tyzack, the closing scene between her and joan hickson is simply magical, the acting is as good as it gets, chilling, moving and totally brilliant.  please let me know if you agree with my words. i am seriously looking forward to the remake to see how well geraldine mcewan's version is. watch and enjoy.

562,"question : is this movie good or bad? 
 answer : bad 
 context : this movie is flawed on many fronts. like many before it, it portrays more of the mythology of the alamo than the history. the production is poor, overall giving the impression of a welfare project for lots of actors who might have otherwise had to work on hollywood squares. this to me was the greatest flaw - i know the ages and general personalities of the real alamo protagonists and the geriatric ensemble of tv actors chosen to portray them never let any hint of believability intrude.  as a native texan, i grew up with the mythology. i later learned more about the history. i can accept a decent production from either perspective (although i prefer more historical accuracy), but this never gave me a chance to enjoy it. even john wayne's or fess parker's versions had more life than this stolid mess, while being only slightly less accurate.  very disappointing - avoid it.

455,"question : is this movie good or bad? 
 answer : good 
 context : i did not see this film in the theater. i confess to an anti-vinnie barbarino bias. who the hell was john travolta to be making movies? i remember the oscar broadcast that year, with travolta looking absolutely devastated when he didn't win. how dare he, when there were ""real"" actors in the running? i'm sorry john, you should have won. after catching this film on cable years ago, i fell in love with the entire movie. bud, sissy, uncle bob, wes, all wonderfully done. i, also, confess to never passing it by when i channel surf. i have to stop and watch. over the years, i've learned to do most of the dialogue, dance with my thumbs in my waistband, and learned to appreciate travolta more. the only disappointing thing to me was the oversight, on the soundtrack, of some of the music from urban cowboy. ""looking for love"" defines the film, but urban cowboy was chock full of classics that didn't make it to the soundtrack. it should have been a double cd........

712,"question : is this movie good or bad? 
 answer : good 
 context : as the superb `prime suspect' series reaches part four there is no loss of momentum at all, this in itself a considerable achievement.' prime suspect iv: the lost child' has the solid supporting cast that we take for granted in these british dramas but of course the beautiful helen mirren easily dominates; our eyes never leave her while she's on-screen.  the search for the lost child of the title leads superintendent jane tennison's cid team to a prime suspect who turns out to be a convicted pedophile now living with a single mother and her two young daughters. the insight we are given into the workings of his mind is one of the emotional highlights of this mini-series but it may be too strong for many stomachs.  the action sequences are brilliantly handled with the hand-held camera thrusting us right into the middle of the excitement and there's gripping tension during the climactic siege.  altogether this is another magnificent police procedural drama.

199,"question : is this movie good or bad? 
 answer : good 
 context : i can barely even remember what decade i saw this film. it was when i was a teenager, i think (i'm 37 now). i started watching it as a late night movie sometime in the mid to early 80s, and so much of it has stayed with me ever since. seeing other comments, i had no idea it was shown at theatres, or that anyone else even new it existed. i don't think i've even mentioned the movie to anyone else.  but half a lifetime later, i still remember much of the movie that i watched late at night so long ago. i think the innocence of the charactors, their situation, their mutual affection over a long period of time, left a long term imprint for reasons i don't quite understand. maybe it is because i was a teenager at the time i saw it, and it touched me somehow..... i really don't know! i also really wanted to know what was going to happen when the after the end of the film happened. oh, the agony!!  i've not seen it before, or since, but i would love to. i keep a casual look out for it, but i now doubt it will been shown and it seems to have faded into oblivion. but i'd proberbly miss it in the tv guide even if it did show up. pssttt!!!  reading the reviews here has renewed my interest. if anyone knows of its availability in australia, by all means email me and let me know.  oh, and sean bury... nice to see you make an appearance on the comments here. i've had a look at your movie history and noticed your last appearance in a james bond film. what are you up to these day? oh, and do you have a copy of the film? cheers!!!

117,"question : is this movie good or bad? 
 answer : good 
 context : i was expecting this to be the same kind of schlock as the previous modesty blaise movie, which is why i left it unwatched for so long, but i was very pleasantly surprised.  far from being a succession of silly gun battles and car/boat chases, it was an almost thoughtful analysis of how a pretty girl gets to become as hard as nails, with nothing being overstated or over-rationalized.  it's likely that the budgetary constraints actually helped with that: less time and effort was spent on finding ever-stupider ways for stunt men to pretend to die, and more was dedicated to making the movie worth watching. hell, the biggest gun battle takes place off screen -- and the scene where it is heard is all the better for that background noise, that adds to the suspense -- who's winning? who's dying?  alexandra staden might not be as drop-dead gorgeous as monica vitti, but few are, and she certainly has every ounce of class and fire that's needed to make the character work -- and the shape of her face, her hair, and her tall, slender body could have been lifted straight from the comic-strip graphics.  nikolaj coaster-waldau was the perfect choice for a blaise bad-guy, in that he made the character interesting and enjoyable to watch -- even likable (and i doubt i'd consider taking on many brutal, psychopathic murderers as drinking buddies). i can't think of a single one of hollywood's ""former waiters"" who could have pulled the role off that well.  fortunately, blaise baddies always die, in the end (no spoilers there!) that's a really good thing, because all the girls who would have spent their time swooning over such a disgustingly handsome and interesting hunk can now pragmatically settle for us ordinary joes.

29,"question : is this movie good or bad? 
 answer : good 
 context : on seeing this movie, i didn't expect much. i was delightfully surprised. although the writing was unpolished, as some of the dialog seemed drawn-out and contrived, the script did have shining moments. (my favorite line, ""life is like a rich meringue, an-and i'm diabetic, so i can't enjoy it..."".) the plot was new and refreshing as opposed to some of the newer more ""main-stream"" horror that most of us are (sadly) growing used to. i do believe some of the scenes could (should) have been longer (and maybe some shorter). the superfluous use of blood was campy but seemed to make sense in the end....ah, the end. the end would have been a little better if they had explained why what happened, happened. (i don't wanna spoil it.) it might have also added to the movie time, which is in the area of ""it's only an hour long, how good could it be?"" answer- quite good.

96,"question : is this movie good or bad? 
 answer : bad 
 context : i gave this a 2, and it only avoided a 1 because of the occasional unintentional laugh. the film is excruciatingly boring, and incredibly cheap. it's even worse if you know anything at all about the fantastic four.

249,"question : is this movie good or bad? 
 answer : good 
 context : the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted. it is a tale that exemplifies the american spirit and the american character. this movie is a story from the early 20th century that is strangely relevant to the political landscape of the world in the beginning of the 21st century. it is a true classic.

204,"question : is this movie good or bad? 
 answer : bad 
 context : i've seen a lot of seagal movies, and while most aren't great, or even good, this steamy pile lowered the bar for bad movies.  the plot: not sure really. something about a drug that makes you all crazy and strong or something. who are the good guys and bad guys? hard to tell. most of the movie is cut scenes going back and forth between people in darkly lit rooms complaining about how good seagals character ""mashall"" is.  acting: blows.  voice dubbing ,,,,,, what was with the horrible voice overdubbing?! could they of found anyone who sounded any less like seagal? may as well had cheech or chong doing the voice overs, might of at least been entertaining then.  this movie is boring, and completely stupid. avoid it at all costs!!!!

941,"question : is this movie good or bad? 
 answer : bad 
 context : if this could be rated a 0, it would be. from the atrocious wooden acting to the dull, plodding pace, the puerile exploitation angle and the sophomoric pseudolesbian titillation added purely for the sake of the sad viewers, this is a disaster of a film.  the plot is predictable, as from the beginning one is absolutely certain of what will happen to all of the characters and how the plot will commence. from a boring, unexceptional beginning to a pathetic and bleak ending, every single presence in this film is wasted, and every meagre scrap of talent dug up for this turkey is squandered.  if you want to watch something as relentlessly bleak with plenty of the same childish titillation, watch one of the ilsa films. at least they're unapologetic and up-front about what they're trying to do. how something this horrendously bad ever managed to be rated above a 5 is a miracle of how people with no taste or discerning standards can sometimes come together for the most dubious of purposes.  it's not scary, it's not interesting, and above all it's not arousing in any sense of the word. it is, in my opinion, a crime; it is a crime that such a horribly offensive and incompetent piece of trash was ever conceived of and given the resources to come into existence, and even more a tragedy that it is still defended by some woefully misguided viewers.  not even elvira's cheerful personality and joking ways could soften the blow that this horrifying travesty of film is. avoid it at all costs.

327,"question : is this movie good or bad? 
 answer : bad 
 context : a handful of critics have awarded this film with positive comments. i don't wish to argue with their opinion, but i strongly disagree. when i first watched this film i was mildly impressed. but after comparing it with other films, particularly with the late master, bruce lee i quickly changed my mind. in fact, if it wasn't for the title of the film, i would never have bought it. game of death 2 doesn't relate to the original game of death, (except it shares one character, billy lo.)  i was stunned to see how similar game of death 2 was compared to enter the dragon. the plots have striking similarities: both bruce lee and bobby lo are on a mission to avenge a relative. the two locations are similar, in which they both are very isolated and are surrounded by thousands of blackbelts. there is an element of prostitution in both films (women are sent two the guests rooms in both films.) both han (enter the dragon) and lewis's henchman have a hand missing. their is an underground drug operation in enter the dragon, believe it or not, there is one in game of death 2. han has a pet cat in enter the dragon, the director has used his imagination and awarded lewis with a pet monkey! the list continues.   regarding other aspects of the film, such as the script and the acting, i felt it was very poor. it seemed to me that the director was looking for a group of martial artists to star in the film and prayed they could act.   on a positive scale, i cannot deny that the choreography is impressive. although the fighting sequences have strong elements of acrobatics in them, they are none the less skillfully performed. however, as the plot is insufficient, i couldn't relate to the characters, therefore the fighting sequences were more exhibitions rather than having a meaning to the film.   in conclusion i would say this film is recommendable to any martial-arts fans, but for those who enjoy a solid action film, with a good storyline and strong characters, i seriously wouldn't recommend this film. my opinions towards this film may seem very bias and one-sided, but when bruce lee set a new standard in the martial arts cinema, particularly after his masterpiece: enter the dragon, this film failed to rise to these standards. if anything they imitated a truly brilliant martial-arts film, in hope of achieving the same level of fame.   in reference to my evaluation, awarding this film a very harsh 1 out of 10, the film is barley watchable, and must be thankful that it had the fighting sequences it did.

333,"question : is this movie good or bad? 
 answer : bad 
 context : i've seen about 820 movies released between 1931-39, and the informer is the worst major release i've seen from that time span. awful, despicable, unpleasant, unhappy, unredeemable saga of a complete loser. watch a 1934 b western instead. 
"
925,"question : is this movie good or bad? 
 answer : bad 
 context : while i certainly consider the exorcist to be a horror classic, i have to admit that i don't hold it in quite as high regard as many other horror fans do. as a consequence of that, i haven't seen many of the exorcist rip-offs, and if exorcismo is anything to go by, i'll have to say that's a good thing as this film is boring as hell and certainly not worth spending ninety minutes on it! in fairness to the other exorcist rip-offs, this is often considered one of the worst, and so maybe it wasn't the best place for me to start. it's not hard to guess what the plot will be: basically it's the same as the one in the exorcist and sees a girl get possessed by a demonic spirit (which happens to be the spirit of her dead father). the village priest is then called in to perform the exorcism. like many spanish horror films, this one stars paul naschy, who is pretty much the best thing about the film. exorcismo was directed by juan bosch, who previously directed the derivative spanish giallo 'the killer wore gloves'. i haven't seen any of his other films, but on the basis of these two: i believe that originality wasn't one of his strong points. there's not a lot of good things i can say about the film itself; it mostly just plods along and the exorcism scene isn't worth waiting for. i certainly don't recommend it!

77,"question : is this movie good or bad? 
 answer : good 
 context : the japanese ""run lola run,"" his is one offbeat movie which will put a smile on just about anyone's face. fans of run lola run, tampopo, go!, and slacker will probably like this one. it does tend to follow a formula that is increasingly popular these days of separate, seemingly unrelated vignettes, all contributing the the overall story in unexpected ways. catch it if you see it, otherwise wait for the rental.
