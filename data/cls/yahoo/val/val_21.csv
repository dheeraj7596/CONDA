"i need help!!? please read this:\n""there is actually a disorder called binge-eating disorder. it is being studied by psychologists. it is similiar to bulimia except you do not purge, you just binge. when i say binge, i mean taking in a lot of calories at once (sometimes up to 3000). this is something individuals with this disorder cannot control and feel extreme guilt over. it is different than just liking food a lot and eating poorly (fast food etc). when people with this disorder binge they often don't even fully chew the food.""\n\ni have got that exact problem or disorder or illness whatever it is and i can't seem to get over it.i've used pills, gone through diets, and got acupunctured but none of them were permanent.i am even thinking of getting my tongue pierced as one of my friends has advised it.what should i do?\nplease help me... it seems to me that the binging might be being used to either compensate or substitute for something the person feels they are missing or are not good enough at- which calls into it the issue dealing with following other peoples's standards- a whole topic in itself. try to see and figure out what it might be that you seek, want, need, etc.,that you are attempting to fulfill or replace by binging. it could be, for example, some issue like...'a full meal you enjoy, even cook as well, is one of the few, possibly only, ways you feel completion, satisfacton, fulfillment?...' maybe even being worth the guilt, which we get used to after a while, actually. back in the day this topic came up within the context of the 'munchies'. i had a friend who satisfied his munchies with raw celery and carrots. i tried it but....well, sometimes there just ain't nothing like a good 'ol reese's cup.....or two....or three:-)   sometimes, and it may be so with binging- i'm not really that familiar with it- the physical act of chewing food can help satisfy the munchies. it's not necessarily the bulk of food that is put into the stomach alone but also the nerve impulses(chewing) that tells the brain that food(fuel) is on the way. i have noticed while having hunger twangs close to lunch, that if i chewed some gum it would make the twangs subside, at least 'till i could get out ...   a big thing is no matter what you employ, drugs, therapy, prayer, to help you with this issue, believe you can & will overcome and defeat it! every day when you get up look yourself in the mirror, in the eyes, and say 'you will not binge today! you don't need to binge and you don't want to binge. you will not binge today!'  best wishes....",train560425,relationship

"what are the different types of computer networks?explain each briefly.? types of computer network\n\n1) a bus network is a network architecture in which a set of clients are connected via a shared communications line, called a bus. there are several common instances of the bus architecture, including one in the motherboard of most computers, and those in some versions of ethernet networks.\n\nbus networks are the simplest way to connect multiple clients, but often have problems when two clients want to transmit at the same time on the same bus. thus systems which use bus network architectures normally have some scheme of collision handing or collision avoidance for communication on the bus, quite often using carrier sense multiple access or the presence of a bus master which controls access to the shared bus resource.\n\na true bus network is passive – the computers on the bus simply listen for a signal; they are not responsible for moving the signal along. however, many active architectures can also be described as a ""bus"", as they provide the same logical functions as a passive bus; for example, switched ethernet can still be regarded as a logical bus network, if not a physical one. indeed, the hardware may be abstracted away completely in the case of a software bus.\n\nwith the dominance of switched ethernet over passive ethernet, passive bus networks are uncommon in wired networks. however, almost all current wireless networks can be viewed as examples of passive bus networks, with radio propagation serving as the shared passive medium.\n\n\n2) star networks are one of the most common computer network topologies. in its simplest form, a star network consists of one central switch, or hub computer which acts as a router to transmit messages.\n\nwhen applied to a bus-based network, this central hub rebroadcasts all transmissions received from any peripheral node to all peripheral nodes on the network, sometimes including the originating node. all peripheral nodes may thus communicate with all others by transmitting to, and receiving from, the central node only. the failure of a transmission line linking any peripheral node to the central node will result in the isolation of that peripheral node from all others, but the rest of the systems will be unaffected.\n\nif the central node is passive, the originating node must be able to tolerate the reception of an echo of its own transmission, delayed by the two-way transmission time (i.e. to and from the central node) plus any delay generated in the central node. an active star network has an active central node that usually has the means to prevent echo-related problems.\n\n3) a ring network is a topology of computer networks where each node is connected to two other nodes, so as to create a ring. the most popular example is a token ring network.\n\nring networks tend to be inefficient when compared to star networks because data must travel through more points before reaching its destination. for example, if a given ring network has eight computers on it, to get from computer one to computer four, data must travel from computer one, through computers two and three, and to its destination at computer four. it could also go from computer one through eight, seven, six, and five until reaching four, but this method is slower because it travels through more computers.\n\n4) mesh networking is a way to route data, voice and instructions between nodes. it allows for continuous connections and reconfiguration around blocked paths by ""hopping"" from node to node until a connection can be established.\n\nmesh networks are self-healing: the network can still operate even when a node breaks down or a connection goes bad. as a result, a very reliable network is formed. this concept is applicable to wireless networks, wired networks, and software interaction.\n\na mesh network is a networking technique which allows inexpensive peer network nodes to supply back haul services to other nodes in the same network. it effectively extends a network b",train518959,computer

"what does the expression ""take the heat of doing sth"" mean, as in ""he took the heat of standing up to her""? thank you. think about it.  if a situation is described as being ""hot"", and a person gets into the middle of it, they're ""taking the heat"".  example: your parents are mad at someone for doing something bad, but they don't know who did it.  they're mad...they're ""hot"".  being ""hot"" refers to the idea of a person's temperature ""rising"" when they get angry, since their face gets all red and everything.  if your parents are mad, and let's say you decide you're going to take the blame for whatever it is, you're ""taking the heat"".  it's also in reference to arguments.  if your boy/girlfriend is mad at you and yelling, especially if you did something wrong, you're once again ""taking the heat"" of their anger.\n\nthat's the only way i can think to explain it.",train1376681,education

"i don't get it how do people lose weight on laxitives?  the only benifit i see is pooping alot? help me understand.  i knew people that used to do it but i never saw them get skinny but they thought they were.  i don't get it. it is extremely unhealthy to try to loose weight with the use of laxatives. what happens is the laxatives put the digestive system in overdrive and the food gets pushed through the system before the system can digest it. so you end up malnourished because your body doesn't have time to get the vitamins, minerals, carbohydrates or proteins out of the food you eat and definitely doesn't have time to store any of it as fat. since your body thinks it is starving, because of the lack of nutrients, it has to start breaking down the reserves it has stored. it will break down fat first to use for energy and when the fat runs out the body will start breaking down muscle. on top of the body basically ""eating"" itself in order to maintain, the digestive system gets so used to the laxatives that when you stop taking them the digestive system won't work. you end up constipated and even impacted because the bowels can no longer move on their own. it's a horrible thing to do to your body.",train248667,health
