"should the ncaa switch to a playoff for the national title? at the end of this season there is very little chance that there won't be at least a few teams with 11-1 records and possibly a second team with undefeated. yet only two teams will have a chance at winning the national title. there will undoubtebly be multiple teams not even getting a chance at the national title regardless of their remarkable seasons. why not have a 16 team playoff, 4 weeks that end on the same day the national title would always be held. it would mean more money from ticket sales for the ncaa and there would be little if any question about who deserved to be crowned national champion. tell me what you think. yes they should. 8 teams. that would give 3 rounds of games. have the first round at the same time the regular bowl games are played. each one of the playoff games should be bowl games as well. it would only go two extra weeks (and that for 4 teams.) the winning team would get money from 3 bowl games, the 2nd place team would have won 2. good money for good teams and you still have all the ""lesser"" bowl games as well. it works for everyone. i would say enough money would come in from the last two rounds to make it very profitble for all involved.",train1065756,sports

"what is just in time? just in time (jit) is an inventory strategy implemented to improve the return on investment of a business by reducing in-process inventory and its associated costs. the process is driven by a series of signals, or kanban (jp. カンバン also 看板), that tell production processes to make the next part. kanban are usually simple visual signals, such as the presence or absence of a part on a shelf. jit can lead to dramatic improvements in a manufacturing organization's return on investment, quality, and efficiency when implemented correctly.\n\nnew stock is ordered when stock reaches the re-order level. this saves warehouse space and costs. however, one drawback of the jit system is that the re-order level is determined by historical demand. if demand rises above the historical average planning duration demand, the firm could deplete inventory and cause customer service issues. to meet a 95% service rate a firm must carry about 2 standard deviations of demand in safety stock. forecasted shifts in demand should be planned for around the kanban until trends can be established to reset the appropriate kanban level. in recent years manufacturers have touted a trailing 13 week average is a better predictor than most forecastors could provide.",train627671,business

"ok  why do men run? why did men run when they hear you have kids?  at 36, most women my age have kids.  i am always up front about them but when men here ""i have kids""  they run for the hills.  would it be better to hide the fact that i have children? well that depends. are you looking for a long term mate or a one night stand.  if it is just a one night stand, then why bring up the kids factor.\nif you are looking for a stable partner, then mentioning kids should be the second breathe you take. think of it as you are not wasting your time because if he doesn't want to be with someone who does have kids, you'd only be wasting your time. it's not like you asked them to babysit. when you say you have kids, you just eliminated the time and effort to find out if he is compatible.",train1087669,relationship
"what exactly is randomness? i recently read somewhere that mathematicians are unable to define or prove randomness. and although some sequences of numbers are categorized as random, these are only educated guesses...please enlighten. randomness is really just what you think it is.  a sequence of 32-bit integers is random if the next number in the sequence can be any 32-bit integer with equal probability, and the sequence is totally unpredictable.\n\ncomputer-based random number generators are useful for a variety of tasks.  statistical simulations is a primary example.  a good random number generator produces a sequence that is 'good enough' for the application.  if you can detect a pattern in its output, it is not a good random number generator.  for example, it generates only odd integers, or the sequence repeats every 17,533 numbers.  one which repeats every 3,447,655,328 numbers is better but is still not random.  proving a sequence is random requires checking it forever to make sure it does not repeat.  obviously that is not possible in the general case.",train815893,science

"do you think that it is a good idea that doctor training is reduced to 4 years in the uk? would you feel safe? there is a proposal to reduce medical training from 5 years, plus a year as a prho, to 4 years in the uk. this is to bring it in line with europe and america. now, a lot of europeans come here because we are supposed to have the best training, and a lot of the american medical boards look at the british system with a degree of respect. now, considering a lot of doctors qualify without even knowing how to prescribe properly after 5 years, how safe would you feel if the training was reduced? bear in mind that pharmacy training has been increased to 5 years, and nurse training takes 3. my husband is a third year med student in the us.  he'll go through a total of four years as a student.  (split in half, two years in classroom, two years doing clinical rotations with preceptors.)  then he'll do an intern year followed by a 3 year long residency.  he's going into im and peds.  other specialities have differing residency lengths.  a board certified residency is required for licensing in the us, along with passing the usmle exams along the way.  \n\nis this similar to the education for docs in the uk?\n\nif it's similar, i wouldn't have a problem with it.  in all, it's at least 8 years worth of post-graduate schooling/training.  that's adequate for a family care doc.  surgeons in the us have longer residencies.  i'd imagine it would be the same in the uk, too. \n\nbut please, correct me if i'm wrong.  it's certainly happened before!",train1351919,health
