"why apple decided to conclude operations in india? from business week:\n\napple has shelved plans to build a sprawling offshore technical support center in bangalore. just months ago, there was talk of apple employing 3,000 workers by 2007 who would handle technical and customer-service support for macintosh computers and other apple gear in india and elsewhere. there was even speculation that jobs would travel to india in the fall to publicize apple's commitment to the country.\n\nit wasn't meant to be, and a small, newly hired staff of about 30 at apple's subsidiary in bangalore was let go recently. (the company will maintain a small sales and marketing arm in the city.) apple spokesman steve dowling would only say the company had ""reevaluated our plans"" and decided to focus support center activities in other countries.\n\nsome questions.  however, another source familiar with the situation said the decision was mostly cost-driven. ""india isn't as inexpensive as it used to be,"" the source said. ""the turnover is high, and the competition for good people is strong."" the company feels it ""can do it more efficiently elsewhere.""\n\nsuch talk comes amid concerns about the sustainability of india's fast-track economy. true, india's economy grew 9.3% last quarter, and it is still home to the world's largest, fasting-growing offshore outsourcing sector, which generates about $17.3 billion in revenues and employs nearly 700,000 people, according to the mckinsey global institute. and indian outfits such as infosys (infy) and tata are among the best-managed companies in the emerging markets.\n\nyet india's benchmark stock sensitive index, or sensex, experienced a mini-crash in late may as global investors fled from emerging market stocks (see bw online, 5/23/06, ""india's market turns down the heat"").\n\nindian brainpower.  and india's fabled infrastructure headaches and surprisingly robust wage growth have also raised worries about india's undisputed leadership as a business outsourcing mecca. entry-level wages have climbed by as much as 13% annually from 2000 to 2004, while salaries for mid-level managers have registered increases of 30% annually during the same period, to a median of $31,131, according to mckinsey and nasscom, india's software industry association.\n\nhowever, while the apple move certainly will generate plenty of media attention -- ""apple software logs out of india,"" proclaimed a headline from the times of india -- it may be a special case. apple has certainly utilized indian engineering brainpower in the past. part of the electronic circuitry that powers the ipod was developed by a research outfit in hyderabad, for instance.\n\nyet for the bangalore operation, jobs never had any intention of outsourcing any high-end software development and proprietary technology research away from the company's cupertino headquarters or operations nearby, according to the source familiar with apple's operations in india.\n\nstrategic tie-up.  also, while wages for software engineers and it project managers have soared, entry level wages for call-center employees are still an affordable $2,500 or so per year. apple had only a staff about 30 at its bangalore operation, but ""you need economies of scale, say 500,"" to generate huge savings for a company, says sunil mehta, vice-president of nasscom. unlike rivals such as ibm-lenovo, dell (dell), and hewlett packard (hpq) that have a huge base of personal computer customers, apple's mac market share is far lower, undercutting the justification for a huge customer service center on the ground in india.\n\nthe bangalore operation also seemed redundant given that on may 29 apple announced a strategic tie-up with new delhi-based hcl infosystems to provide distribution and after-service care for apple's phenomenally successful ipod line. hcl has a tremendous distribution and service footprint in the country and ",train1327117,computer

"light year mean what? a light year is a light-year is a unit of distance. it is the distance that light can travel in one year. light moves at a velocity of about 300,000 kilometers (km) each second. so in one year, it can travel about 10 trillion km. more p recisely, one light-year is equal to 9,500,000,000,000 kilometers.\n\nwhy would you want such a big unit of distance? well, on earth, a kilometer may be just fine. it is a few hundred kilometers from new york city to washington, dc; it is a few thousand kilometers from california to maine. in the universe, the kilometer is just too small to be useful. for example, the distance to the next nearest big galaxy, the andromeda galaxy, is 21 quintillion km. that's 21,000,000,000,000,000,000 km. this is a number so large that it becomes hard to write and hard to interpret. so astronomers use other units of distance.\n\nin our solar system, we tend to describe distances in terms of the astronomical unit (au). the au is defined as the average distance between the earth and the sun. it is approximately 150 million km (93 million miles). mercury can be said to be about 1/3 of an au from the sun and pluto averages about 40 au from the sun. the au, however, is not big enough of a unit when we start talking about distances to objects outside our solar system.\n\nfor distances to other parts of the milky way galaxy (or even further), astronomers use units of the light-year or the parsec . the light-year we have already defined. the parsec is equal to 3.3 light-years. using the light-year, we can say that : \n\nthe crab supernova remnant is about 4,000 light-years away.\n\nthe milky way galaxy is about 150,000 light-years across.\n\nthe andromeda galaxy is 2.3 million light-years away.",train485211,science
