 answer : society 
 context : why is there no evidence that supports intelligent design, or debunks evolution? all i hear is that there is no evidence that supports evolution; and that the evidence we do have is invalid or wrong. i have heard that carbon dating is off because of the waters from the flood. another good one i have seen is that the devil planted fossils in the earth to deceive us. these things are humorous, but far from evidence. i will give you that evolution is, in some places, incomplete; but it at least has evidence that strongly supports it. for example: why is it  that a bat's forelimb is far more similar to a human arm than a bird's wing? their bone structure in their ""arm"" is almost identical to our own. but, where is the creationism smoking gun? i will tell you where...it does not exist. excellent post.\n\ni get quite tired of the strawman versions of evolution and the scientific method trotted out by creationists.\n\nfor example, the big bang has nothing to do with evolution.  zero.  \n\nwhere the first life form came from has nothing to do with evolution.  zero.\n\na theory is simply the best explanation for observable data.  we witness the diversity of life around us, and we must explain it somehow.  it is not meant to be proven.  theories, in general, are not intended to be proven.\n\nfor example, gravity is a theory.  is gravity false?  no.  does gravity follow certain rules?  absolutely!  yet it is still a theory, and there ain't nothing wrong with that.\n\nyou well noted that some mechanisms of evolution are still not completely understood.  the theory, while perfectly valid, is not completely explained (just like gravity).  however, what creationists must keep in mind is that if any theory is going to replace evolution, it must explain all the evidence and data we have collected.  genetics, fossil record, geological record, geographic isolation and allele frequency shift.\n\nat the very best creationism (or id) only points at the parts that science has not explained.  it offers no real alternative theory.\n\nlastly, the idea of ""proof"" for a ""miracle"" (meaning god's flooding of the earth) is oxymoronic, at best.  if there is proof (meaning observational data we can see today) then there is a natural explanation and god had nothing to do with it.  if it was a miracle, then there would be no evidence (since god suspended natural laws to make it happen).  silly christian fundamentalists, they want to have their cake and eat it too.

(cheating) this explanation is what everyone eventually resorts to when the other answers fail. now, before i go any further, i should make clear that i'm not talking about any of the gods defined in various religions. throughout all of human history, we've been trying to explain existence. but nobody has ever succeeded. and it's likely that nobody ever will. so we create the concept of god, whose only necessary property is being ""that which explains existence."" \n\nthis doesn't tell us much about god, though. it doesn't mean that any particular religion is correct. it merely defines god as something which answers the question, because we have not been able to.

(by the way if your going to work on this problem.... i need a job! nobel prize committee please refer prize to richard l. hardeman of bullhead city az.) what you are saying is possible, yet the weight or gas would have to be escaping from earths atmospere or else the mass is still there.  it is a very intetresting idea, though.  \n\n if the weight of the earth dropped then the distance between the earth and sun would increase since the mass is directly proportional to the force between them.

(religion) because those people are afraid that if you think about religion in a scientific manner then youll raise questions that cant be answered by religion.  \n\na real person a faith shouldnt ask you to forget what you learned just because it might challenege their ideas.  religion isnt perfect and neither is science.  they may or may not work together but as of right now we dont know the ultimate trusts about both subjects so its very hard to tell when they really do agree or disagree.\n\nlearn both sides and decide for yourself what is true. don't let others make you think that blind faith in either is necessary or okay.

 context : what is the movie about a man who dreams of dakota fanning? a casting call is out, anyone know about it? there's been an add placed for young actresses in wales to act as extras in a dream sequence during a movie. the movie is about a guy who dreams of dakota fanning, and there are hundreds of her in this sequence. there's talk of it elsewhere, that dakota's people have been meeting with the man behind this alleged project, and she herself may be involved in it. i can't find out who this guy is, but i suspect he's already famous. whoever he is, he's quoted as saying that dakota smells of raspberries. what’s most endearing about her, though, is that she comes across is a surprisingly down-to-earth and personable kid. in a recent roundtable interview in kansas city to promote her new movie “dreamer: inspired by a true story,” the young actress cheerfully bounded to the head of the table and was ready to field questions faster than reporters could start asking them.\nin the film, she plays a girl named cale crane who convinces her horse trainer father (kurt russell) to raise a wounded filly named soñador back to racing shape.

 context : what myths involve vultures? what do they represent? in greek mythology, the vulture is the descendant of the griffin.  it was a very buddhist-like, zen-like symbol of the non-dual oneness of heaven and earth, spirit and matter, good and evil, guardian and avenger.  the vulture is the avenger of nature spirits.    ancient assyrians believed the vulture was, like nagarjuna's middle way, sunyata, the encompassing overall non-separated union between the day and night.\n\nin egyptian mythology, nephthys (spelt nebet-het, and nebt-het, in transliteration from hieroglyphs) is one of the ennead of heliopolis, a daughter of nuit and geb, and the wife of set. \n\nshe was banished to the desert.  as she was also seen as a bird, she gradually became seen as a vulture, which the egyptians believed never had children due to being believed to all be female (they thought vultures were spontaneously created from air). although vultures were seen in a positive light, their feeding behaviour nevertheless lead them to be associated also with decay and death, and so nephthys too gradually became a goddess of death and decay.
