"norton antivirus or macaffee? whic do you like better? why????? in all honesty, i think they are equal in terms of what they can/do.  they are both big players in the market and do their job well.  there is enough competition between them to keep them on their toes to provide you the best anti-virus service and definition files.  for me, i would only weigh two things - price and reputation.  if the prices are close, and i would guess they are, i would opt for symantec's norton antivirus software.  this is only because they seem to be more widely recognized, in my opinion.  how this has any affect on the overall product, i would doubt it would carry any weight.  it just makes me more comfortable going with a product that i feel has a bigger share of the market and, therefore, might have a better overall product.  norton av wins 51% of my vote.",train1276549,computer
